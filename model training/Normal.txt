Jasper wildfire has caused '30 to 50 per cent structural damage,' says Alberta premier
"Sarah galashan was listening to that news conference a lot to cover uh Sarah but that what we heard there from uh the premier 30 to 50% structural damage again this is preliminary but we also have been able to verif verify some video and we do see significant structural damage and and buildings burned to the ground yeah Andrew I mean it does speak to the video that we're seeing it's a the video is showing a small section but it's really complete loss in those videos that we have seen and the idea that uh potentially at least because at this point the fire is still it is still burning out of control around Jasper um but at least half possibly of Jasper lost to this Wildfire you could it was an extraordinary show of emotion coming from Premier Danielle Smith that she was fighting back those tears and really you know sharing in the grief that we know is being felt by all those thousands of residents uh and tourists but primarily those those residents who were forced to evacuate on Monday uh some of them still in town throughout British Columbia some of them making their way back to evacuation centers in in Alberta um but we have heard in the leadup to this uh calls for them to seek uh support and that supports are available and you could see that there even the the premier there in an emotional state as she described that law as a place that is so special to the residents but also to thousands if hundreds of thousands of people around the world for whom Jasper is a bucket list trip a place so beautiful that they have or still want uh to visit uh because of the the spectacular Beauty around uh that area in that mountain town um in terms of the firefight it is as I say still ongoing uh there is rain in the northern half of the province we heard but also Gusty winds and you talked about the devastating effect that the wind had last night on that fire forcing uh those Flames forcing uh emergency Personnel Wildland firefighters to have to evacuate because as structures um became uh engulfed in flames it's a totally different kind of firefight we heard it releases toxins into the air and so only what we call structural firefighters were able to stay behind and and fight off what they could uh and heroes certainly they are uh but obviously not all structures could be saved and and that's what we've heard you also heard in that press conference I think we could call it some subtle frustration at the the the place at the table or lack thereof that the province has had in terms of making decisions when comes to this firefight what it is right now is because it's in h Parks Canada territory here that it's a unified command between the town of Jasper and Parks Canada and of course relying on resources coming from Alberta wildfire and we heard about those resources that were deployed they unfortunately couldn't use the night vision aircraft because of all the smoke in the area but it was all on hand for them that Alberta uh clearly very much wants to have a seat at the table in terms of making these decisions uh we know that uh Federal ministers are are are on root going to be having discussions uh with the provincial government I heard her say as well she'll be speaking with the prime minister at 2:30 PM mountain time and she reiterated the fact several times Daniel Smith did that they will be uh asking for calling for a more unified command involving the province so that uh all resources and the decisions around utilizing them and and deploying them can be made very quickly it wasn't not positive toward the the calls that they have had with hargie Sedin uh but they they want uh to be part of that unified command it's a sort of a unique situation given that we're we're talking about Parks Canada here uh but as you said we'll be hearing from Parks Canada uh in terms of I suppose what's to come what has happened here and perhaps more of an update as to exactly what has been lost in Jasper but the pictures we already knew were devastating that we have seen and now to hear such a high percentage of the Town may be lost that is going to be hitting people certainly throughout Alberta and in many communities in British Columbia where those evacuees still are are going to be thinking very hard yeah I I mean there's so so many questions about how this happened and some jurisdictional questions of course people are dealing with just the loss of these structures we did hear an official say it is true that uh provincial night vision helicopters were made available to the town to Parks Canada last night but because of the conditions it was just too dangerous to use them so that is what an Alberta official had to say uh about that but so many more questions and so many more answers that we uh hope to hear from officials at all levels about how this happened and and how this this this fight is going as it continues for now though Sarah thank you the CBC Sarah galashan"
"this was me at my heaviest I wasn't ever truly happy with the way I looked but one day I didn't recognize my body my usual sizes didn't fit me anymore so I got more and more frustrated at myself for letting it get to this point fast forward and this is me today 10 kilos lighter and I'm feeling the strongest and healthiest I've ever felt in my life I think it's so important to look at why most diets fail rather than jumping straight into what exercises to do or meal planning for the week your experience may be different from mine but I always failed my diets when I gave in to quote-unquote bad food like sugary snacks bubble tea chips anything when you indulge on bad food usually it feels pretty good at first but then it follows with this chain of emotions that you usually bring upon yourself like self-pity guilt disappointment and even self-forgiveness when you start a diet usually either consciously or subconsciously you have an idea of what foods you should be saying no to and usually those are the foods that you really enjoy so at diet for me was always a constant test of my willpower to not eat those delicious food but the longer I go without the food that makes me happy the less happy I'll feel for one maybe one day I will crave it a lot and then give in therefore failing my diet you get the wave of emotions the cycle repeats but then your patient starts to run thin for yourself so how do we stop food from calling our name on our weakest day since when did food become a hundred percent no bad food and 100 food straight from the ground how do we not get tempted by all the food around us now that I'm on the other side I recognize how those internal conversations kept me and potentially many others in a very vicious Loop so in today's video I'm going to be sharing my five tips to ease yourself into your weight loss journey and Lead this healthy and balanced lifestyle that everybody talks about one of the biggest challenges that I didn't know I needed to face at the start of this weight loss journey is actually emotional eating I tend to turn a food when I'm feeling stressed accomplished in need of comfort or even when I'm bored and while there's nothing inherently wrong with enjoying food it can become a problem when it becomes a coping mechanism breaking out of this has been difficult and it's taken a lot of mental fortitude to overcome my dependence on food to feel good I thought that if I could stop the cycle of cravings and just break that entirely then maybe I can actually be successful at my diet for once and that's when I discovered this book by Janine Roth Breaking Free from emotional eating contains practical tips and strategies for overcoming emotional eating and I love that the tips are all taught through the experiences and reflections of people who are also going through the same struggles one of the most important things I've learned is to stop using food as a reward instead of celebrating a productive day at work with a massive meal or a sugary snack I try to find other ways of rewarding myself like through giving myself the free time to do anything that I wanted even if it's Doom scrolling even if it's reading a book as long as it's not food related something else I've realized is that if I stop putting my favorite foods on a pedestal I actually usually end up thinking about it less and therefore craving it less don't think about elephants what are you thinking about another strategy has been to practice mindfulness and self-awareness when it comes to my eating habits and my emotions when I turn to food for Comfort I just like to take a moment and pause to check in with myself am I really hungry or am I feeling stressed if it's the latter then I try to find other ways to cope like journaling maybe that will help or even talking to my partner about how I'm feeling this book really pulled me out of this tunnel vision with food and I started to realize just really how manipulative it can be it's time to get started without those Cravings holding you back links down below you won't regret it if you want to learn more about how your body stores fat and other tips for accelerating your weight loss goals then keep on watching when dieting I always focus on cutting calories and increasing my cardio but I realize that there's another really important factor to consider and that is insulin insulin is a hormone that helps our bodies to store energy from the food that we eat when we eat our bodies release insulin to help move that energy into our cells but if our body these are constantly bombarded with food our insulin levels can remain elevated which can make it harder for us to burn fat or enter fat burning Zone insulin also spikes depending on what types of foods you eat so instead of opting for a carb heavy meal that can spike your insulin and then cause a sugar crash or a food coma try and find nutrient dense foods that will keep your insulin low and steady to be honest I was never really one for diets and the word diet can mean so many things nowadays if you look it up on Google you'll find two meetings one refers to the types of foods and drinks that a person consumes regularly and the other refers to a temporary reduction of food and drink usually for the purpose of losing weight the idea of restricting myself and calorie counting just seems so exhausting for one and unsustainable I just wanted to eat whatever I wanted and still be skinny and that leads us to our next tip which is intermittent fasting I think some people might view intermittent fasting as some sort of diet that's on the same playing field as these days diet but it's more of a long-term diet that doesn't actually limit the amount of food or the types of foods that you can have instead it's just a little bit more restrictive in terms of when you can eat so if I can still have ice cream bubble tea and all those great things but I just need to have them within a certain time of the day then that's a pretty good trade anyway so I gave it a go and I set my eating window between 12 P.M to 8 PM every day the idea is to limit the amount of time that your body is producing insulin and to be honest at first I was skeptical after understanding a little bit more about insulin it sort of makes sense to keep it around only for a portion of the day rather than sporadically throughout the day by sticking to my eating window and allowing myself to eat whatever I wanted within that time frame I found that I was able to satisfy my Cravings in moderation without feeling deprived and because I was only eating during a limited window of time I found that I wasn't constantly thinking about food intermittent fasting has truly been a game changer for me you can eat the same thing but if you just timed it differently it could be the difference between you continuing to put on weight or losing weight I would recommend starting off this journey with more of a stronger focus on the nutritional value of food rather than the numerical value of food like three calories you want to set yourself up for success and while calorie counting is a very easy and common way of tracking the amount of food that you've had I feel like it's quite easy to lose sight of what is actually good for your body not all calories are made equal so it can be misleading if you just relied on the number to determine what you can and can't eat especially when we're busy and on the go I feel like it's quite easy to lose sight and Pick convenience over health I still remember when I used to choose fast food for most meals and I would still feel very good about it it was a cheaper faster more convenient option and it still fit within my calorie limit so I convinced myself I was going to be losing weight even though I was eating KFC every day but then I would experience all sorts of fatigue because the food I was eating wasn't nourishing my body and that's why I would recommend starting off your journey with more of a focus on nutrition rather than calorie counting it's more aligned with your long-term health goals anyway and it's good to get some practice in for making those decisions so that would look like paying more attention to things like fiber Protein healthy fats and generally making sure that you're getting a good balance of everything is much more sustainable and important for your long-term Health the great thing about this method is that it allows for so much flexibility and Variety in your diet you can still have fast food just have it in moderation but more importantly focus on things that will make you feel your best of course this doesn't mean that calorie counting is not useful or that it doesn't work it definitely works I just don't think it's very suitable as a daily measure to maintain your health over the long term even for me like calorie counting put me into a scarcity mindset and I started to make very poor decisions with my food that I'd urge you to focus on what you're fueling your body with rather than calorie counting one thing that has been key to my weight loss journey is the art of showing up and the power of a routine when we make healthy habits part of our routine it's more likely to stick with us over the long term of course building a routine isn't easy it takes time and effort to build new habits and sometimes we're going to fall back onto our old patterns and that's why I've found this book Atomic Habits by James clear to be incredibly helpful clear's approach to Habit formation emphasizes the importance of small incremental changes that will add up over time on days where going to the gym seems extremely far-fetched just by simply putting on my leggings changes that from uh I don't really feel like it today to I need to move my body there's just something about outfits and how they can just really put you into another headspace and then my next goal is to Simply Rock up to the gym just get there that's my next goal the point is to not look too far ahead just focus on what next that will help you towards getting to where you need to be because when I look back just a small habit like wearing leggings it's the difference between going and not going to the gym which is huge can you imagine the amount of progress you'll make to anything that you do if you just mastered the art of showing up and the power of a routine and of course there are still days where I slip up or fall off track whether it's starting my day with oxyshred or putting on my leggings maybe even preparing my leggings the night before or prioritizing sleep these habits have become an integral part of my daily routine and setting myself up for making better decisions I hope that these tips are helpful for you and that you feel inspired and motivated for your weight loss Journey it will take some time but if you implement each of these steps and get good at them you're moving forward with the best mindset possible and the best environment for you to thrive without your Cravings holding you back I'd also really love to know your thoughts on my tips did you learn anything new are you already implementing any of these I'd love to know down in the comment box below I will be checking them out and thank you so much for watching I will see you in my next one if you enjoyed today's

How I lost 10KG in 12 WEEKS and kept it off | 5 Simple Tips to Start! 
Clean Eating For Beginners | Never "diet" again
"clean eating does not have to be complicated and today i want to show you what an easy day of eating clean and healthy can look like simple whole food recipes with everyday ingredients that you can find at any grocery store and less than one hour of standing in the kitchen exactly like my six week clean eating mastery program but more about that at the end of the video the simplest way to make a wholesome healthy breakfast is to take one minute the night before to prepare it yes one minute that's what it takes to make overnight oats and it's super super simple absolutely delicious the next day and it's just a grab and go breakfast so let me show you how to make it all you have to do is add three quarters of a cup of old-fashioned rolled oats to a sealable container also add three quarters of a cup of your favorite milk any milk works plant milk cow's milk whatever you love and then place it in the fridge overnight and the next morning you can top it with some berries and drizzle a little maple syrup over it and enjoy it now if you work outside the home you might want to prepare your lunch the night before as well but even if you work from home it's always a good idea to have lunch ready in the fridge because that way we just grab it and eat it and we make sure we eat clean and healthy and don't grab any unhealthy snacks because we're ravenous and we really don't want to prepare anything for us so let's prepare lunch for tomorrow shall we pull out your instant pot to cook some quinoa or check out my guide on how to cook quinoa on the stove add one cup of quinoa and one cup of water to the instant pot because that's the minimum necessary to get it to pressure and then place a trivet into the pot as well and add two large fridge cold eggs to it we will only need one egg for the lunch bowl but since i'm cooking double the amount of quinoa i might as well add another egg and have everything ready for a second lunch bowl for another day i love that i can cook quinoa and hard-boiled eggs at the same time in the instant pot and it only takes one minute on high pressure plus full natural pressure release now let's prep the veggies get a lebanese cucumber a carrot a handful of grape or cherry tomatoes and a small handful of parsley then peel the carrot and then julienne or grate it cut off the ends of your lebanese cucumber and cut it into slices and lastly finely chop your parsley and set all of this aside now it's time to prepare your dressing but be vigilant of your instant pot so you don't miss the moment natural pressure release is over or else your eggs will overcook you want to make sure that as soon as the safety pin drops you want to take out those eggs and put them in the ice bath to stop from cooking for the dressing you want to add the juice of half a lemon one tablespoon olive oil and sea salt and pepper to taste to a sealable jar and then shake it until well combined by now your quinoa and eggs are probably ready remove the eggs immediately as i said after the safety pin dropped and add them to the ice bath to stop the eggs from cooking further and now it's already time to assemble your quinoa lunch bowl add half of the quinoa you cooked into a sealable container then top it with your julienned carrot your sliced cucumber your grape tomatoes and lastly your hard-boiled egg then seal it and oh wait wait wait wait i forgot the chopped parsley it's not complete without the parsley now seal it and place it in the fridge together with a dressing pour that over your lunch bowl only seconds before you're ready to dive in or else your cucumber and veggies will become all soggy so do that the second you're ready to eat your lunch now for dinner let's keep it simple but still super super delicious get two skinless boneless chicken thighs and season the heck out of them here i have half a teaspoon paprika half a teaspoon oregano a quarter teaspoon chili powder half a teaspoon sea salt and a little bit of black pepper add the spices to both the sides of your chicken thighs and then set them aside now get a small sweet potato and peel it and then cut it into about half inch slices make sure they are not much thicker than that or they won't cook through now preheat a large pan over medium heat and once it's really hot add a splash of avocado oil to it and place both your chicken thighs and sweet potato slices into the sizzling oil and brown for five minutes on one side and five minutes on the other before you add a splash of water to the pan to the glaze the bottom and also add a handful of green asparagus and cover the pan with a lid reduce the heat to low and let this all steam for approximately 20 minutes or until the sweet potato is tender when you plate your chicken sweet potato slices and steamed asparagus don't forget to pour the delicious pan juices over everything it's the best part and there you have it a full day of eating clean breakfast took one minute to prepare lunch 15 to 20 minutes and dinner 40 minutes but of those 40 minutes you didn't have to do anything for 20 because everything was steaming right so if this day looks and sounds delicious to you and you want to make clean eating part of your lifestyle the best way to change your eating habits is to commit to that change for at least six weeks that way you internalize it that way it becomes a routine and somewhat of an automatic daily decision after six weeks of eating clean and healthy you will feel amazing and you can't even imagine eating junk food and processed food on the regular ever again if you are finally committed to turn your life around you can start today by joining the six week clean eating mastery program and i have all the information you need for that in the description and that is it for today i hope you enjoyed the video and maybe i'll see you in the six week program that would be so amazing i hope you have a wonderful day bye"
Week of Nourishing Breakfasts
"[Music] I am so excited to be back in my kitchen today I filming and sharing a week of nourishing breakfast SL brunch ideas today is Monday so I'm about to whip up breakfast sometimes it's grab and go today I'm just in the mood for something extra extra yummy so you'll see hopefully it will just encourage you to step into your kitchen even if it's like I always say just to create one thing this week makes a world of difference for more of my recipes more ideas more inspiration you can head over to my website at ww. Tish wonders. co.uk go and check out all of my recipe ebooks over there so let's put Monday's breakfast SL brunch together let's cook it let's do it let's go I'm really in the mood for Turkish eggs but I don't want to poach my eggs so I'm going to do it all in one pan and I'm going to add some I've got some jar roasted red peppers I'm going to add some of that in um but I'm just you know when you're just craving something like I want eggs I want yogurt I want the spiced butter M yum I'm going to start off by doing the yogurt first because the eggs will cook in minutes so it's good to have the yogurt ready before so I've got some Greek yogurt I've got some dill a lemon garlic so grab a bowl and place in the Greek yogurt um and squeeze in some lemon juice I like to throw a touch of garlic some people like to throw cloves of garlic in I'm like no no no let me just add a little bit of garlic ideally it will be finally finally grated just make sure it is not chunky completely completely optional you can chop up and you can throw in some fresh dill place a little bit of salt in you could use parsley if you prefer that whatever herbs you like go with whatever you like the taste of whatever you have as well just like I mentioned with the yogurt we're actually going to prepare the butter in advance as well so once the eggs are cooked we can just throw this together so grab a pan heat it on a medium heat place your knob of butter in so let everything melt down and place in your alipo pepper plus your chili flakes so give your pan a really good Shake making sure that the butter is fully infused and just place your pan to the side so there's not much to do with these roasted red peppers we're just going to open up our jar drain a few Peppers off and simply chop them up if you don't want to do the step and you actually just prefer like a classic Turkish egg dish then you can just poach your eggs but like I mentioned I don't want poached eggs today I want eggs cooked as you're about to see on a low to medium heat place a little olive oil into a pan and place in those Jarred chopped red peppers cook for a minute or so and then crack in your eggs season with some salt and some pepper and then cover your pan reduce the Heat and cook your eggs for about 5 to 7 minutes just keep an eye on it I definitely for this recipe want a runny yolk I grabbed my little bowl I placed in that garlicky Dill infused yogurt topping it with those gorgeous eggs not leaving even a speck of that [Music] butter those eggs oh my my God that's how that's how I like an egg oh my God makes me so happy wow I need another piece of toast that's how you start Monday it's going to be a good week so it's really early I'm definitely that person that like wakes up with an appetite like I love obviously clearly love breakfast I don't train before 7:30 I have to eat something before I train and I haven't trained yet so I'm going to head to the gym but before that I'm going to make a little porridge very very simple sometimes when I'm lying in bed I think M what am I going to have for breakfast like those thoughts come into my head um so last night I was like let me put some oats to soak and I also added in some of this musle which is just a standard basic mus I sometimes like adding some musi in just because of the dried fruit that's added and there's like sunflower seeds in here Brazil nuts I just put everything to soak in a sauce pan can doesn't look great now but I'm actually going to just drain the water off and then just add some almond milk and it's going to cook really really quick everything's kind of softened anyways and I'm going to add my toppings on top very very simple breakfast this morning I really go through phases of loving oats and I'm definitely in an oat phase right now I'm going to add some Greek yogurt on top I've got some berries and I've also got some seeds so every now and then I know I've spoken about it before I'll really get into seed cycling and this month I've just been on it so I've got a blend of pumpkin seeds and what else flax seeds that I whizzed up in my blender earlier on this week I don't feel like I've ever properly committed myself to seed cycling over like a long period of time but I always have intentions to so maybe it's going to be a thing from now on the first half of my cycle um I will sprinkle on top pumpkin and flax seeds and then for the second half of my cycle um which is like the beginning of the Lal phase um up until my period actually comes I will do sesame seeds and sunflower seeds apparently there's a science behind it I don't know maybe you guys have had some experience with seed cycling but what I do know is that there is absolutely no harm in adding extra pumpkin seeds flax seeds sunflower seeds and sesame seeds um to whatever I'm eating throughout the month so let me put this porridge together cuz I've got a class that I need to get to [Music] some almond milk obviously you can spice the porridge up however you want you can add nutmeg you can add cinnamon uh this cinnamon by the way this Vietnamese cinnamon is so strong it's really potent I'm not complaining it's delicious but my goodness you only need a little touch of this stuff definitely got into the habit of adding in a protein powder when I'm eating oats and actually you know what I can feel the difference I'm not well versed when it comes to protein powders I'm not the most scored on that topic but when I do use a protein powder if I use a protein powder it has always been this form one this has been a long-standing favorite of mine which I have repeatedly bought form recently sent me an extra packet cuz they saw how much I liked it this one's in finished so it's just come in good time um but yeah I'll usually add like a little bit of protein powder into my oats as well and then I'll have the Greek yogurt which has also got extra protein I love the unsweetened ones just because I'm a bit sensitive to overly sweet things but they also sent me some of their other flavors to try which I will give a go maybe in smoothies um but for now yeah this unflavored one does it for me I have the tiniest drop of coconut milk I love coconut milk just adding a little bit at the end just cuz it makes it super creamy um sometimes I'll add 100% coconut milk but today it's a mix of almond and coconut favorite part of my morning when I'm having porridge is choosing the toppings obviously this honey that I picked up recently is so delicious it's from a shop in Hackney called food for all on K and off road if anyone is wondering I'm also still in my hemp seed phase so hemp seeds are just a must and then along with that I've got some bee pollen from raw pop which is just the best the best of the best I've also got a variety of berries so strawberries blueberries and some raspberries I placed on top some Greek yogurt all of those berries a little touch of that honey some hemp seeds plus that blend of pumpkin and flax seeds which I spoke about earlier finishing with some bee pollen there is no holding back when it comes to the toppings it's my favorite part yum I'm thinking what am I going to cook up for my breakfast SL brunch today I did some hot yoga this morning which always takes it out of me but it makes me feel really good at the same time and I did some weights um but after I eat I know I'll be feeling more energized I was in St Lucia a few weeks ago and my dad randomly made this it was so good it was like this tuna fish fata which if you're not a tuna person you'll probably be like no way I'm just going to try off the top of my head do what I think think he did but I have no idea if it's going to work out or turn out the same way because that was a good fata but it's basically just tuna onions I think he threw garlic in there which I'm probably not going to do but I'm just going to do tuna onions and um eggs I was also thinking cherry tomatoes would work really well cooked within the fata type thing that I'm about to cook but I think I'm in a uncooked keep it fresh cherry tomato type of mood but we'll see let's go with the flow let's see let's see how it turns out let's do this so grabbing a red onion if you don't have a red onion of course a white onion is going to work just fine even if you want to use spring onions that will be perfect too so I'm going to use a little bit of olive oil I actually might throw a little bit of butter in there as well just a combination of [Music] both I'm using a little bit of ground black pepper place a little salt so I'm going to add a little bit of oregano in there as well so this is my dandelion and Tulsi Tea it's probably been sit oh God teapot is not that great is it so whilst those onions are cooking down nice and slow I'm just going to crack my eggs into a bowl give them a bit of salt and then throw this thing together and it'll be done in no time I don't think I'm going to put those tomatoes in I think I'm going to put the tomatoes on top so I cracked my eggs into a bowl use as many eggs as you desire I used three eggs for this and then I opened my tin of tuna so once your onions have cooked down and they have softened you can place in that chuna got a little bit of green seasoning that I'm going to add in if you want to add any kind of hot sauce chili sauce that you like you can do that I'm just going to add a touch a green seasoning so combine the tuna and the onions before placing in those whisked eggs so I'm going to put it in the oven at about 10 oh my God let me turn this off actually it's a bit too low about 180° I'm going to leave in there for about 10 minutes 10 minutes maybe 12 minutes we'll see I'll keep an eye on [Music] it have some fresh tomatoes and I've also got some uh I've got some rocket I think in the fridge as well but this is going to be delicious this looks completely different to the one that my dad made so I actually need to get a full breakdown of that recipe properly I think but um I know this is going to be delicious either way you know what I put salmon in a fata but I had never put tuna and it's just this is one that you're going to make again and again once you try it I only plated three pieces but I'm going to grab that last one more fresh tomatoes and like you know when you're eating a meal Midway through and you're like you just top up your plate let me put a banic as well ooh yes please thank you I had a breakfast this morning I just wasn't able to film it cuz I was in such a hurry to rush out the door it was really early but I had a really filling smoothie so I'm not so hungry I an oat and raspberry smoothie I used that same protein powder it was really delicious it was also very very filling as well so I'm not the hungriest but I do feel like lots and lots of steamed greens this morning so I'm going to steam some broccoli if I want a really nourishing breakfast something that's going to make me feel good that's super simple this is the perfect example lots of steamed greens with salt and a good olive oil oil A protein that feels good for me which is usually eggs and um maybe a few other things on the side I've got an avocado so I'm definitely going to add some avocado onto my plate and I've got these like piadas these little flatbreads which are delicious I'll probably warm some of those up just said that smoothie was filling now I'm talking about like a whole five course breakfast but if you know me you know I can eat I also wanted to share with you what I've been using over the past few months these are element electrolytes I had about five boxes of these and I'm down to this is the box which is just filled with all the random flavors so if you're someone who feels really low energy after you train obviously that could be for so many reasons but it would be worth just seeing if it's the case of you're not replenishing um the electrolytes that are lost just through sweating these are my favorite so every time I go to the gym and I know I'm going to sweat a lot I do um a whole one liter flask of water and I just add a whole sachche in and just sip sip on it it's the best so yeah anyways let's put together today's official breakfast a little stacking of the dishwasher a little tidying up before I get going tidying up this morning smoothie making mess I fancied a little peppermint tea you know herbal tea bags are never strong enough so of course I doubled up and I grabbed those steaming trays said it before I'll say it again steaming trays are probably my most loved possession in my kitchen they get the most use I love them couldn't be without them so yeah put my broccoli to steam and I chopped up some cherry tomatoes I combine them with some Basel some olive oil some oregano and a little bit of salt you know what I cook that plant in I cook half the plant and I've had it all so I'm going to fry the other half I still like my broccoli with a little bit of a bite you know I don't want it overly overly cooked I want it cooked but not overly cooked placed on some salt and this gorgeous olive oil that I'm using today very generous amount so whilst My Pan was Heating to cook my scrambled eggs up I just chopped up some avocado the last thing to do was to cook these scrambled eggs so what I do is I heat my pan on like medium heat and then once I put the eggs in I turn the heat off completely the eggs are still going to cook but they're just not going to dry out they're not going to go dry just stirred for maybe like 30 seconds or so until I reach my desired type of scrumbled eggs obviously if you want to cook them for a bit longer you can and then just serve them serve them up [Music] so just so you know these are the pienas that I used you can find these I think you can find the big ones in s bre but the mini ones you need to check weit tros out I think they're the only Supermarket I've ever seen the mini ones so they are really really delicious you know what there's just something about having cooked vegetables in the morning cooked greens specifically tell me that adding a bowl of steamed greens to your life for 7 Days won't change how you feel the combo never gets old eggs planting avocado I chopped up some cherry tomatoes with some torn Basel add a little bit of dried oregano olive oil and a little pea perfect so it's a Friday and I want a super Speedy easy quick tasty brunch um so I'm going to put together just butter beans with Chay tomatoes and garlic sounds basic simple and it is basic and simple but sometimes basic and simple works well if you have a good tasting Bean makes all the difference I've got a bit of bread I tried out this sourdough a couple of weeks ago it's um let me show you it's called Jason's sourdough so this is the seeded one they also have a white sourdough but I haven't tried out that one but it's really tasty just remembered I've also got like ah my favorite got some cottage cheese I'll just spread that on the toast and then I will put those cherry tomato butter beans garlicky cherry tomato butter beans over it so starting off we will just have our cherry tomatoes you can use any type of tomatoes that you have by the way and also if you're using cherry tomatoes and you'd rather just keep keep them whole and throw them in the pan as they are that's also fine so I grabbed my pan just heating it on a low to medium heat and whilst that was heating up I just finally chopped up my garlic so adding a little bit of olive oil into the pan I threw in all of that chopped garlic on a very very low heat really important that you don't burn your garlic you just really want to cook it gently for a few minutes shortly after you can place in your chopped cherry tomato just giving everything a good stir seasoned with some salt and some pepper if you want to like I did you can add in a little bit of dried oregano and just continue stirring continue moving everything in the pan as those cherry tomatoes break down and just become infused in that garlicky olive oil just gets so delicious um you can go ahead and open up either your jar of butter beans or your carton or your tin of butter beans so yeah I just gave my butter beans a good rinse before throwing them in the pan along with those cherry tomatoes so combining those butter beans and those cherry tomatoes you can place in a little bit more black pepper if you want to and just let those butter beans and cherry tomatoes just do their thing on a low heat just let them cook for around 5 minutes for a little extra touch I'm going to stir a little bit of red pesto in that I had in my fridge which actually need's using so ratio of cherry tomatoes and butter beans was a little bit on equal usually I prefer a few more cherry tomatoes in something like this um so that's why I looked in the fridge and I found red pesto and just thought yeah this will be the perfect addition so yeah just last little bit I just needed to toast up my toast and um put those butter beans on the toast so this is the riverford cottage cheese and for me it's probably the best tasting cottage cheese that's out there if you're in the UK excited finished with a little bit the basil simple but effective and delicious let's have a taste you've been seeing my concentration food face my food concentration of face all week M that's Andre to no it's actually red pepper pesto but that red pesto definitely works oh my God this is so damn good let me know in the comments which one you'll be making you might be making two you might make three you might make all of them let me know really hope these ideas have just given you that little push that we all need sometimes it's fine um just to step into your kitchen get to cooking create a beautiful meal for yourself because you deserve it I will see you all in my next video very very soon I'm going to go sit down and enjoy this I want to sit down in peace and enjoy this meal see you all soon [Music]"
Octopus vs Underwater Maze
"This is my pet octopus named Sashimi. And this is a vault\nfilled with all her favorite food. The only problem is,\nin order to get to this vault, she'll have to rely on her incredible\nintelligence and dexterity to make it all the way through this\nnine part underwater obstacle course. And just like when I made my backyard\nobstacle course for squirrels, out of the gate,\nI will admit in hindsight, I completely underestimated the\ncapabilities of this remarkable creature. But to understand how we even ended up\nat this spot, we need to go back in time six months when I decided to get a pet octopus to see\nfor myself if they were really as smart as people say they are. And after bringing her home to CrunchLabs and putting her into a saltwater optimized and appropriately decorated tank,\nshe made herself right at home. And the first thing that stood out is just\nhow curious they are. For example,\nwhen you put anything into the tank, including your arm, they immediately\nswim towards it and just want to interact. And we'll cover this in a minute. But beyond just being able\nto really securely latch on to things like my hand It’s so strong! Oh my goodness. Her suckers are also gathering information about me,\nlike my smell, taste and color. And so after just a few weeks, given how playful she is, it's hard\nnot to form a quick bond. For example, she loved to go up and wave\nfour tentacles in the jet stream, which I assume is the octopus equivalent of a dog sticking its head out of a car window. She could play catch with us, she had a propensity for selfies\nany time she saw a camera. And whenever we put a toy\nsubmersible in her tank, she would go full 20,000\nleagues under the sea. And as I did more research,\nI learned that for the 100 million octopi every year us humans\nput on a dinner plate or in a pet store, basically, all are born\nand originally raised in the ocean, meaning they aren't bred in captivity, which is when I was hit\nwith the startling realization that essentially made me the bad guy in Finding Nemo. And since no one wants to be the bad guy\nin Finding Nemo, as much as we'd already come to love Sashimi here at CrunchLabs,\nwe did some investigating and found out from the\npet store we got her from the exact spot they pulled her out of the ocean. The only problem\nwith my plan of returning her, was she'd been hand fed\nnow for quite some time. So the idea was that if she could figure out\nand remember how to solve an obstacle course maze then I would be assured\nthat she could figure out and remember her early days\nhunting in the ocean and we could send her back home\nwith confidence. Phase one of the plan\nwas to give her some challenges and then observe her behavior\nto understand what capabilities she actually had. And as it turns out... it's a lot. For starters, their ability to color\nand shapeshift is unmatched in the animal kingdom. For example, can you spot the octopus\nhiding in plain sight right here? The only thing more impressive than that is when you slow it down. Play it in reverse and see just how quickly\nand convincingly these changes occur. And it's not just camouflage\nas a form of protection. They can also mimic the shape of larger,\nmore predatory animals like eels. And as Sashimi shows here,\nand you can see here, they’ve even come up with\nsome pretty creative ways to scoot themselves around. There’s stories from octopus researchers\nwhere they will recognize and shoot water at only one specific person\nany time they walk by the tank. And they'll still recognize that person, even if they switch clothes\nwith other people or other stories where the octopus will repeatedly shoot\nwater jets at the light switch to turn off the lights in the room. It's also not uncommon for them to escape\ntheir tanks at night to better map out the room\nthey're being stored in or to raid the other takes for food only\nto return to their tank in the morning like nothing ever happened. And after a month or two of observation once we had really come to understand each other we had all the data\nwe needed to enter phase two. So after a lot of brainstorming, CAD, 3D printing, and laser cutting. We eventually landed here starting at the conclusion of the \nnine part obstacle course with the Golden Vault. If she can figure out how to unscrew\nthe vault door well then she’s earned the 3 pounds \nof her favorite food: shrimp contained therein and the reason we know it's her favorite\nfood is because over the course of a week, we've prepared an underwater seafood\nbuffet with four different food options. And all four times\nwe repeated the experiment the aroma from the shrimp was consistently\nthe most irresistible. But in order to earn that succulent\nreward, she's got her work cut out for her, starting back at the beginning\nwith challenge number one the over-under. If she finds a way to get under\nthis barrier through these rocks well then she's got to find a way\nto get over this barrier, through these floating balls. And if she manages that,\nthen is through the green circular portal, where she'll find herself face to face\nwith this four panel revolving door. And if she works out\nhow revolving doors work and makes it through the next green portal well then Sashimi will basically be met by a wall and at this point it's game over. Unless she correctly deduces that by pushing this block out she can pass through the corridor and continue her journey upwards\nto the ball drop. And this is where things level up a notch because dexterity becomes much more critical in this case\nshe has to grab this lever and rotate it in this slot,\nwhich will allow it to fall down with the balls trailing behind, clearing\nup the pathway upwards through the tube. But then once she swims up\nthe tube, she'll be trapped because the porthole out is blocked\nby this red gate. that is unless she figures out\nhow to hit the emergency exit button, which will push this\nglass counterweight ball down off the edge, thereby\npulling the gate up and allowing entry into \nperhaps my favorite obstacle, the fish out of water. Because here the only way \nfor Sashimi to continue her progress would be to flex her ability\nto comfortably live on land for up to an hour\nby crawling out of the water up over and back down on the other side, where after passing through the portal she gets a bit of a power up, because on the back side of the\nsnorkeling Phat Gus is a shrimp. Now, this is a bit of a throwback\nto the tourist trap on the squirrel maze, where a strategically placed snack\nled to a timely photo op. But in this case I call it the Medusa because the hope is that as she eats\nthe shrimp with her beak on the underside of where\nher legs all come together it will look like Phat Gus has eight\nbraids of beautiful, flowing hair. And now that she's feeling refreshed, Sashimi can hopefully finish strong\nwith the penultimate challenge, which is sort of a double obstacle because there are six holes in the top ranging from small to really small. And if she takes the easy route\nby squeezing through the least small hole. Well, and she has a lot more maze to deal with as opposed to the smallest hole That puts her right at the finish. Either way, at this point,\nshe's made it here. And if she solves the final puzzle\nby unscrewing the vault door, she's not only earned the \nall-you-can-eat seafood buffet but she’s proven she's quick enough on her tentacles to handle being returned back to her ocean home to the very tide pools\nshe was raised in. So with everything in place, all that was\nleft to do was open this ball valve. And as the smell of fresh shrimp\nmade its way to her tank she made her way down the tube like an eight-legged gladiator\nto her saltwater colosseum. So while we wait for her to\nmake that 40-second trek this is the perfect time to mention that if you want a Christmas\nmorning reaction like this or this, or this, Yes look. Then a CrunchLabs Build Box \nsubscription is the answer. Because with the build box not only do you get a super fun toy that\nyou get to put together every month but you do it alongside me while I teach you all the incredible physics behind\nhow it works. We're right there in the trenches, building, learning, and succeeding together so the principles really sink in. It works. So if you're a kid and you're looking for something\nto put at the top of your Christmas list, or you're just looking to be the household hero\nby giving it to someone else, use the link at the video description\nor head to CrunchLabs.com where were giving away two free boxes\nas a holiday special. Now back to Sashimi. After making it into the main tank then sort of exploring the borders \nof the maze for a bit, she made her way inside fairly quickly,\nbut then sort of just chilled, like she really didn't understand\nwhat she was supposed to do next. But since you can only ignore the ambrosial\nsmell of raw, fresh shrimp for so long she eventually got curious\nand started exploring. And one of the first things we observed\nis that any time she's in a new environment,\nshe kind of maps things out by walking around\ngathering data with her arms as opposed to just swimming around\nfreely through the middle. And soon enough\nshe had things figured out. Now, admittedly, this first challenge\nwas a bit of a softball because having observed\nSashimi in her home tank I knew she was good at digging\nand burrowing herself in the sand, using the water propulsion from her siphon\ntube to clear the rocks away. The floating balls\nwere even less of a challenge for her, and after making it through,\nyou really get a sense of how much she sends out her arms\nas scouts to gather critical information, especially in the wild They can reach their arms around\nand inside crevices, not only to smell not only to smell and taste but, as we'll cover in a minute,\neven see and independently think. So obstacle one was pretty straightforward but figuring out\nhow to operate a revolving door would be a much harder test... Wow. Okay. I see how this is going to be. And this was my first real indicator that\nwe were headed for a real battle of wits. It was a similar feeling to\nwhen the squirrels eventually outsmarted my rope bridge of instability,\nbut just jumping over it altogether. And I really should have seen this coming because as you can see in this video\nof an octopus escaping from a ship, as long as an opening\nis bigger than their beak, which is the only actual hard\npart of their body, then they can eventually squeeze\nthrough it. In fact, if we roll that back. You can see Sashimi’s beak\nor mouth right here. And while this part looks like a big nose,\nthat's actually their main body where all their vital organs reside,\nlike their brain, stomach, gills, kidneys, ink sack, siphon. And there are three hearts. Two other cool facts about octopi is their\nblood is blue because it's copper based, since that's more efficient\nin cold, low oxygen environments. And if they lose an arm,\nthey can regrow it completely and it will look indistinguishable\nfrom the original. Next up was the block push. Once again, she got to this point and was sort of stumped\nwithout an obvious path forward. But this is where their\nnatural curiosity pays off because she's not just feeling surfaces\nwith her arms but also constantly pulling and pushing\nto see what she can interact with. And so sort of by default,\nshe figured out this red part of the wall doesn't push back as hard which cleared the way up to the ball drop. And I knew this one would be tough for her\nbecause, number one there's not enough room for her\nto just squeeze by. And number two, pushing and pulling on\nwalls wasn't going to solve it either. And after struggling in vain\nto find out what she was supposed to do for quite some time, eventually she got\nfrustrated and just stopped and sat there, almost like she was processing\nall the data she just gathered and this was the moment I knew for sure\nI was in over my head because while basically maintaining\neye contact with me as a flex, she reaches up with one arm and then \ntwists the bar, which dislodges the ball allowing her to clear them out \nand move on. And this feels like the perfect moment\nto tell you that my absolute favorite fact about the octopus\nis that they are truly the closest thing we have to intelligent alien life\non this planet. And here's what I mean by that. This is a very simplified version\nof a tree of Life. These kind of diagrams show\nyou how all life is related and what evolved from what. How do we know this? Well, by being true scientific detectives\nand looking for clues. For example, a few hundred years\nago, scientists noticed that us humans have seven vertebrae in our necks,\nbut so did giraffes. But wait a sec. So do whales, mice, elephants, \nlions, horses, and bats. So that's a clue they all share a common ancestor\nand belong to this group called Mammals. And it's not just neck bones Watch what happens if you compare\nthe arm bone configurations of a human to a bat, to a chicken,\nto a turtle, to a dolphin. It's wild what tiny beneficial mutations\nand millions of generations can produce and of course, with genome sequencing\ndeveloping over the last 40 years, it's allowed us to compare\nthe DNA of different species and sort of check our answers in the back of the book. Anyways, using these techniques, if you want to see where our lineage broke off from that of octopi\nin the Tree of Life, you have to go back over half\na billion years ago to a simple flatworm. But if you look closely,\nall of what we think of as the smart animals are over here on this \nside of the tree of Life, including dolphins, dogs, pigs, horses,\nhumans, but even birds, dinosaurs and fish and their intelligence and way of thinking\nare all related to each other. Sort of like those arm bones I showed. But octopi developed their intelligence\ncompletely independently from everything over here,\nlike an alien from another planet. And that's why they're built\njust so differently from us. For example,\nthey have twice as many neurons as a cat. But unlike all the animals over here,\nwhere all the neurons are focused in the brain, in octopi,\nonly one third of their neurons are in the brain\nand the rest are in their arms, which means they not only smell and taste,\nbut they can even think and act independently with their arms. That means that\neven if their arm is cut off, the arm can still camouflage itself\nto the surroundings by sensing light. It would be like closing your eyes, walking into a room, touching a wall\nand having your hand match the color. Having eight independent mini brains,\nalong with a larger central brain is as incomprehensible\nas alien intelligence to us. Now, back at the maze,\nSashimi had made it to the emergency button, putting her at the halfway mark,\nand as usual, she starts by having her arms do all the recon work. And it's almost like once she feels\nthe red door, she figures out my trick and then immediately pushes the button\nto drop the ball and open the gate to move on to my favorite obstacle,\nthe fish out of water. And I was relieved to see\nthat I'd thrown her another curveball because after quite a bit of\nexploratory arm expeditions, she realizes that the only way forward \nis up and out. And so after psyching herself up, she just goes for it, sliding up, over and eventually down. And this demonstrates\nanother octopus superpower because they can survive out of water\nfor up to an hour. And as you can see here Shawday! Theres an octopus eating a crab! It's one of the reasons\nthey're such successful hunters in and around tide pools. And now that we're coming down\nthe final stretch, I figured she deserved\na bit of a snack break with the Medusa. And just like I'd hoped, once\nshe saw the shrimp attached to the back, she starts chomping down with her beak. And since that's right\nat the center of all her legs we get a couple different hair options\nfor Phat Gus starting first with a more free-flowing \nsandy blonde option which eventually morphed\ninto more of a dark-haired up-do. Now, the reason\nshe's able to change her appearance so drastically is because all octopi\nhave four tricks up their sleeve. First,\ntheir skin is covered in tiny little sacs called chromatophores, filled with either black, red or yellow pigment,\nand then they use their muscles to stretch those sacs like a balloon to achieve\nany combination of those three colors. Then they've got a layer below\nthat called Iridophores that bounce back\nspecific wavelengths of light, giving those iridescent blues\nlike peacocks or beetles. Then there's even one more layer\nthat reflects back ambient light called Luciphores. On top of all that, they can also use\na muscular structure called papillae to change the texture of their skin,\ncreating ridges and bumps. And because they could change any of those in\nas little as 200 milliseconds, which is literally less\nthan the blink of an eye, it makes them the true masters of disguise\nin the animal kingdom. Now, she was on to the maze and you can\nsee she opted for the largest hole, which of course means she had the maximum\namount of maze ahead of her. And I love this because it's sort of\nclassic Sashimi at this point, but you can see she's\nwilling to play along for quite a while and make just about every possible\nwrong turn along the way. But then eventually she's over it\nand just cuts right to the end. And while that's technically\nan automatic DQ I took the high road and let it slide. which brought her to the Golden Vault. After a month\nor so of training on all the obstacles, she had finally done it,\nand with the tide on her side, she went straight for the door,\nripped it off the foundation, and then immediately basked in the sweet,\ndelicious taste of a hard earned victory in the largest\nstockpile of shrimp she'd ever seen. And after letting her gorge for a bit, it was time for me\nto uphold my end of the deal and give her the Finding Nemo happy ending\nshe deserved by driving her 8 hours down the coast back to the exact beach\nwhere she was raised. Having figured out and remembered \nthe solutions to all my dumb puzzles I was convinced she could certainly figure out\nand remember what it was like to hunt for her own food\nin the open ocean. And this was a bittersweet moment because there's one octopus fact\nI haven't mentioned, which is their entire lifespan\nis only about one and a half years. And as a final act after laying her eggs,\na female will continually watch over and protect them to the point\nthat she stops eating and dies. Which meant that in the exact same coves\nin tide pools that her mother did for her, soon Sashimi would be extending\nthat ever changing tree of life by one more generation, only, perhaps this time creating a new branch of super-intelligent\npuzzle-solving offspring. With everything you know\nabout Sashimi at this point it should come as no surprise. She also has incredible taste in toys but what should also\nhopefully not surprise you after watching the videos\nI've been making on YouTube for 12 years, is that learning science and engineering\ndoesn't have to be sucky and boring. Which is exactly why\nI started a toy company called CrunchLabs with the expressed goal of helping kids\nthink like an engineer through monthly toys that\nget delivered to your door where you put it together with me. And having already shipped\nmillions of these boxes. The data is in; 87% of kids rate it and 8 out of 10 on a fun scale, out of ten. But here's the dirty secret. More than three out of four parents said their child gained a new passion\naround STEM and engineering from the boxes. Our secret sauce here, just like on\nmy videos, is hiding the vegetables so everyone leaves\nfeeling stoked about the outcome. On top of that, each month\nyour box has a chance to contain the platinum ticket,\nand if you get it well then you're coming out here to CrunchLabs\nto build with me and my team for day. So if you want to embark\non this monthly journey with me and get a Christmas morning\nreaction like this... Yes Oh my God. Just go to CrunchLabs.com or use the link to the video description where we're giving away those two boxes free\nas a holiday special. Thanks for watching."
Backyard Squirrel Maze 1.0- Ninja Warrior Course
'- This is a bird feeder, and everything to my left is my attempt at making it squirrel-proof. If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass\nthrough what is basically an eight-part "Ninja Warrior"\nobstacle course for squirrels. This course is extremely challenging. It is not for the timid of heart. But out of the gate, I will admit that in hindsight that I completely\nunderestimated my adversary. Now if you\'re wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back eight weeks ago when I found myself stuck\nat home and very bored. So I installed a bird feeder and decided to become a birdwatcher, and it was just so lovely\n(birds chirping) (record scratches)\nuntil they showed up. Now, luckily, my bird feeder\nhad a wire cage around it, big enough for the birds to slip inside but small enough to prevent the squirrels from getting the food, and that worked really\nwell until right here. For me, this was like the\nmoment in "Jurassic Park" when they realized the\nVelociraptors can open door handles. And once the door was open, it was clear this wasn\'t\ntheir first rodeo. They basically cleared this\nwhole tube of bird seed by the end of the day. Mind you, this bird feeder was advertised as being squirrel-proof. So I bought another\nsquirrel-proof bird feeder to replace it. It\'s got this outer cage\nsuspended by some springs, and so if a bird comes and lands here, it doesn\'t weigh that much and it has access to the seeds. However, if a squirrel comes,\nthey\'ll grab onto this cage. Its weight will force the springs down, thereby preventing access to the seeds. I have no idea how the squirrels could\npossibly outsmart this, but let\'s see. And this one work exactly as intended. You can see the birds love it, but when the squirrel comes along, the cage shifts down and now all the seed ports are covered up. Every time they tried,\nit was the same results. However, the next morning, this guy manages to unclip the springs that hold the cage up, which means the cage stays\nin the lowered position where it blocks all the seed openings. Problem with that is now\nthey can get to the lid. But this bird feeder\nlid doesn\'t hinge open to give direct access, so he goes with a different tactic, (bird feeder clanking) (birds chirping) where he now has access to\nall the bird seed he wants. And so I decided I would try\none more bird feeder design. Okay. Wow. It almost feels intentional at this point. This one\'s supposed to work well because it\'s got this baffle, which is supposed to keep the squirrels from just coming straight\ndown and getting to the seeds, and more importantly, there\'s no way for them to rip this off. We\'ll see. This one debuted to similar results. As he hangs by a few toes, this is when I really started\nto gain an appreciation for what they were capable of. It definitely seemed like this bird feeder was their favorite. Okay, yeah, they\'re\nflexing on me for sure. And at this point, a plan\nwas forming in my head, but just to be thorough, I moved the post away from the fence. And I can\'t say I was surprised\nwhen they just climbed it, nor was I surprised to\nsee they could shimmy up and down a small metal pole or even a large one for that matter. And whether they could climb\na certain pole material was a moot point anyways because of this! Look at this! These guys are basically freaking\nrodent-sized Simone Biles! And on some level, this is what it felt like\nwhen someone stole a package from my porch that didn\'t belong to them, and I harnessed that indignation, spending a year designing the\nglitter bomb bait package. - Hello. (glitter bomb whirring) - [Mark] Complete with special fragrances. - Aw. - If I could design a\npackage to deter thieves, could I design a bird\nfeeder to deter squirrels? And so after a couple\nweeks of brainstorming, designing, and building\nwith my buddy John, we put it all together in\nthis 20-second build montage. (upbeat music)\n(tools whirring) (aerosol can hissing) (metal clanking) (drill whirring) Here are the basic elements. For starters, here\'s where I\'ve placed\ntheir favorite bird feeder, at the end of the course. And to sweeten the deal, right below that, there\'s a trapdoor. And if they step here, it releases a butt-ton of walnuts and unfurls some celebratory banners. Why walnuts? I\'m glad you asked. I\'m using walnuts because\nover the course of a week, I put out a buffet of seven\ndifferent nuts and seeds. And all four times I\nrepeated the experiment, walnuts were always\nthe one they ate first. What\'s great about placing this here is it levels the playing\nfield as the birds can fly up and get as much food as they\nwant anytime they need it. The squirrels, however,\nwill have to work for it because the only way to\nmake it to this platform is if they work their way through my eight-part "Ninja\nWarrior" obstacle course, which all starts right here. This is the only platform on the course that has a pole that isn\'t\ncovered in slippery stuff, which means this is where\nthey have to climb up to enter the course. If they try and get up any other way, they can\'t keep a good grip and they just slide back down. So the first challenge is\nthe Bridge of Instability. Now, this may look easy, but the trick is it attaches\nat a single point on each end. And from a physics standpoint, that makes it no different than trying to crawl across a tightrope. It\'s the same deceptive principle with that one carnival\ngame that\'s so impossible. I broke it down in another\nvideo where I use physics to show which carnival\ngames were basically scams and the science on how to beat them. Next up, the Maze of a Thousand Corridors. This one\'s a bit more cerebral, but if they make it through that, it will bring \'em to\nthe Pitchfork Tumblers, which are inspired by the show "Wipe Out." But unlike "Wipe Out," I should point out that all these contraptions\nare squirrel-friendly, and even with a little back force, they will break away and stop spinning. Now, if they can make it past the Pitchfork Tumblers of Treachery, they come to one of my personal favorites, the Homewrecker. (romantic music) I put her in to tempt the\nsquirrel to lose focus on the real prize at\nthe end of the course. Because this pad has a\npressure sensor underneath it and it connects to a microcontroller that has a relay that\nconnects to a solenoid that connects to a pneumatic piston that connects back to this platform with the pressure sensor, and so if they stand here\nfor more than three seconds, they\'ve gotta start the\ncourse all over again. Next up is the Slinky Bridge of Deception. I\'ve suspended a juicy\nwalnut right in the middle, but there\'s no way this bridge\nwill support their weight. So it\'ll be interesting to\nsee how they approach it. The sixth challenge is\ncalled the Tourist Trap. It\'s actually a bit of a\nreward for making it this far. If the squirrel sticks their head through this board my wife painted, it\'s just a photo op\nthey can hang on the wall of their tiny squirrel nest. I\'ll place a walnut here as an incentive for them not to miss\nthis unique opportunity. The penultimate challenge are the Quad Steps of Great Elevation. This is taken straight\nfrom "Ninja Warrior," and this is super tricky because these pads are all totally smooth and placed at a 45-degree incline. And now for the last challenge. At this point, they are a near few feet away\nfrom their ultimate goal. But if they\'re not careful, they\'ll have to deal with\nthe Orbital Assist Platform, aka the Final Countdown, aka "It\'s not a catapult,\nit\'s a squirrel-pult," which means they now have to go back and start all the way\nover from the beginning. Now, if they wanna avoid that fate, they just need to stand on this pad for less than three seconds. But once again, I\'ve\nplaced a diversion here. This one projects an optical illusion of anything you place in\nthe bottom of this dish. It\'s actually super trippy and looks even more\nimpressive in real life because the projected image is 3D. They\'re like nine bucks on Amazon, and I put a link that\nexplains the juicy physics of how they work in the video description. Now with regards to squirrel safety, I know I seem to have this reputation of (fire sizzling) (glass shattering) (people screaming) improvised high-speed projectiles, and so this one might worry a\nfew animal lovers out there, including my wife. We have five pets and one child, and the child was the\nonly one I had a say in. So rest assured, I can adjust\nthe pressure on the piston, and we\'ll be staying way\nbelow any launch force that could hurt any of our\nadorable backyard contestants. And so, finally, after\nmaking it through all that, we\'re back here at the world\'s\nmost satisfying bird feeder. And as far as I\'m concerned,\nif they make it here, they\'ve earned the right\nto gorge next to the birds for as long as they want. And so after nearly a month of prep work, the course was officially\nopen for business. (lighthearted music) They could smell the walnuts\nat the final station, and you could see the gears turning because right above that was\ntheir favorite bird feeder. And so before long, we\nhad our first contender. (bright electronic music) That didn\'t exactly go as planned, so Rick decides to regroup. Speaking of which, that\'s Rick. There are a total of four competitors that will be attempting the course. First up is Rick, and he weighs 500 grams. I know this \'cause he\'s actually standing on a custom-made scale. Rick is very clever as\nyou\'ll see here in a minute, but he also gets spooked easily. Next up is Marty. He\'s basically\nindistinguishable from Rick. Rick and Marty are inseparable and pretty much spend all\ntheir time together as a pair. Our third contender is Frank, also coming in around 500 grams. He\'s very gutsy. He\'s also kinda dumb. Finally, we\'ve got my\npersonal favorite, Phat Gus. He\'s just really charming and will strike a pose\nif he sees a camera. He also really likes to eat, and he tips the scales at\nan impressive 800 grams. While most of the squirrels\nare kind of particular before making a selection and then gracefully leaping away, Phat Gus just goes for it, hands-free, just makes himself real comfortable. Here he is laying out with a light snack from the bird feeder. I mean, you can\'t fault the guy for just clearly appreciating a good meal. So now that you know our four contenders, let\'s get back to Rick. So he hops back on, and he\'s actually doing\nbetter than his first attempt. Mm, just barely. This is the best because he\'s like, "Okay, I got this. Nevermind. Well, maybe I, no, I definitely don\'t." And this was the exact moment I realized I just might be outmatched here. (playful music) Marty was watching Rick and, after a quick dip\nof his toes in the water, adopts his strategy right out of the gate. Ooh, so close, but an excellent recovery. And Phat Gus, perhaps predictably,\ncomes up a little short, which brings us to the Maze\nof a Thousand Corridors, which, to be honest, they\nmastered this one pretty quickly. Here\'s a solid run from Phat Gus. And now for the Pitchfork\nTumblers of Treachery. Marty was like, "Yeah,\nthat\'s a hard pass." Phat Gus is just like, "Abort!" Frank is just like, "Nope." Then he\'s like, "Wait a second. Mm, still nope." Then Marty flies in real hot over the top. He didn\'t make it through, but that\'s partial credit\nas far as I\'m concerned. And then here\'s Phat Gus with\nmy favorite attempt by far. (bright music) And then Frank shows no fear, which helps him pull up\nthis near-flawless run. And finally, Smart Rick\nsurgically weaves his way through essentially untouched. And I should mention, the squirrels were most\nactive from 6:00 to 10:00 AM, so every morning I\'ve been\ngetting up before the sunrise to start filming from in my house, like one of those camouflage\nnature photographers, only like a suburbanized version. I\'ve also had a handful of\nstreaming cameras rolling 24/7, which has allowed me to\nmake such discoveries as we have the world\'s worst guard dog. Thanks for the help, pal. Now back to the Homewrecker. You could see Rick is\ninstinctively suspicious of this gold digger and only for a brief\nmoment puts his full weight on the platform. I told you he was smart. His buddy Marty, on the other hand... She is a cruel mistress. And because I know my\nwife is going to ask me, no, this will not hurt the\nsquirrel for two reasons. Number one, they are amazing like cats and always land on their feet. And two, they themselves were jumping from this height all the time, and in some cases, much higher. In fact, squirrels are\none of the few mammals that can survive a fall from any height because they make their\nterminal velocity so low. You can see it right here. They make their body as flat as possible, then put their tail back to increase drag. They basically become their own parachute. And then right before they land, they pull in and fully\nextend their arms and legs to act as shock absorbing landing gear. This is so cool. Now back to the course where even Smart Rick\neventually lets his guard down, which is exactly when she strikes. But just like all the\nother obstacles so far, after a day or two, they\'d mastered it. In this case, even disregarding her\noffering of a fresh walnut. Now onto the Slinky Bridge of Deception, and this was the sleeper\nobstacle in my book. That is not a large gap,\nwhich they can easily jump, but having the slinky there\njust threw them off somehow. You can see how much\nFrank is struggling here, and he\'s the brave one. And Rick only jumps when Marty shows up for emotional support. But like all the obstacles so far, after a day or two, they\'d mastered it. Now onto our third to last\nobstacle, the Tourist Trap, and this one was just a freaking delight. A little peanut butter\nreally did the trick here. (camera shutter clicks) (playful music) Now here comes Phat Gus. And I mean, how Phat Gus is this? He sees the camera and he\'s like, "Paint me like one of\nyour French squirrels. Yeah? No? No takers? All right." Here\'s another classic Gus where he looks at the\ncamera, wait a second. Play that back,\n(electronic whirring) and freeze. Zoom, enhance.\n(electronic beeping) (record scratches)\n(eerie music) (air whooshes)\n(keyboard clacking) (lighthearted music) Well, turns out Phat Gus is\nnot a dude and he\'s pregnant, which meant I was suddenly\nfeeling real uncomfortable about all those weight comments. So after a bit of a pivot\nto smooth things over, we soldiered on to the Quad\nSteps of Great Elevation. Frank comes in rather\nconfident, almost to his demise, but he pulls off the smooth recovery. So after not much time at all, they were looking pretty good here. In fact, one morning, I noticed Marty totally skipped\nthe last step altogether, which I took as a challenge, and so I removed the middle\nstep to see what they would do. And who else but Phantastic Gus? Let\'s slow that down a bit. They\'re such amazing jumpers, so I suppose the quick mastery\nhere wasn\'t a surprise. I mean, this right here is\nprobably a 10-foot jump. And here\'s some classic\nbrave but dumb Frank. He\'d already entered the course normally and made it to the Homewrecker\nat least a dozen times by this point, and yet for some reason, he decides this 12-foot jump\nis his best course of action. And Smart Rick was the first\none to enter the course. So in the end, after\nabout a week of effort, it was fitting he was the one to make it to the jackpot first. And he\'s so stoked he apparently wants to run\nthe whole course in reverse. In hindsight, we probably should have made\nthe jackpot a little quieter. Here\'s Marty, as always, not far behind. (light music) He\'s also a bit flighty as you know, which worked against him here, because down below, Phantastic Gus, ever the opportunist, comes through with the\nreal stroke of brilliance. But pretty soon, Marty comes back like, "Um, I\'m the one who kinda earned that." And then Phantastic Gus is like, "You snooze, you lose, sucker!" And might I just say, Phantastic Gus, when you sit like that, you don\'t look an ounce over 700 grams. Eventually, they learned\nthat sound was a good thing and they\'d quickly return for their reward before Phantastic Gus got any ideas. So here\'s a single camera\nshot of a full run. And by the end, all of them\ncould do the full course in less than 40 seconds. And while we\'re watching, you might be wondering what\nhappened to the squirrel-pult. Unfortunately, they didn\'t\nreally fall for my illusion much, but I\'m about to show you\nthe two times they did. And as a promise to my wife, I turned the pressure\nto only 40% full power, so the acceleration\nthe squirrel would feel is about half a g, which is 10 times less than\na typical rollercoaster. Additionally, I never turned on either the Homewrecker\ntrapdoor or the launch platform when I wasn\'t actively\nwatching from inside my house where I had a manual override button, because as safe as it was, something about launching Phantastic Gus just didn\'t feel right. Now what you\'re about to see\nis gonna look pretty chaotic. But when we check the slow-mo, amazingly, I\'ll show you how the squirrel is totally in control pretty much the whole time. All right, now here\'s a second angle. Also, even if you don\'t\ntrust my calculations, I can assure you that the\nsquirrels did not care. In both launch cases, they were back up on the\ncourse in like five minutes. Here\'s the slow-mo, and see if you could spot the\ntwo critical things he does to make sure he lands feet down. Did you catch it? The first critical moment is right here. He\'s already done the predictive math, and he\'s locked his head on the\nspot where he plans to land. And now his head will not lose\nthat lock the whole way down. What\'s crazy is the time it takes him to do all the predictive math to know exactly where he will land and to lock his head is 300 milliseconds. That\'s exactly this long. Literally less than the blink of an eye. That blows my mind. But if you think about it, it makes sense these\nreactions would\'ve evolved to be razor-sharp if you live your life in the trees constantly making split-second decisions. Now, besides picking the\nlanding spot with his head, the second trick is with his arms. When he wants to keep his\nupper body from rotating, he has his arms out. But the moment he wants to\nrotate his upper body quickly, he tucks them in. And then when he wants to stop rotating, he extends them out again. This is straight up conservation\nof angular momentum. It\'s the same trick ice skaters use. Basically, bring your limbs\nin if you want to rotate fast, extend them out if you\nwanna slow the rotation. My buddy Destin from Smarter Every Day also made a video analyzing\nhow cats always land on their feet, and they do the exact same two tricks. The head target lock and bringing limbs in to rotate and out to stop rotation. (air whooshes)\nHere\'s the second launch. So this may look like\npure luck in real time, but the slow-mo tells a different story. In that amount of time, he\'s already made a slight\nlateral push in that direction and locked his landing\ntarget with his head. We know from the previous\nclip he can rotate his body to any orientation, but he doesn\'t in this case because he sees his small\npush has already aligned him for the perfect landing. That\'s just so cool. And so after those two\nphysics demonstrations, I disabled both the Launcher\nand the Homewrecker trapdoor and just let them enjoy\nthe course in peace. As far as I was concerned,\nthey had earned it. Plus, after spending a month together, we were sort of bros by this point. If they saw me coming out to work, they would certainly jump away, but then they\'d just\nquickly be right back. And sadly, all good things\nmust come to an end. And because I didn\'t want them to develop an unhealthy\ndependence on my handouts, after about a week of free\nreign, I took down the course. But in its place, I put up a specialized\nsquirrel-sized picnic table. Every morning, this door opens to\nrelease just a few walnuts as a little treat to remind\nthem of our good times together. Although I had to laugh\nthat after all this, somehow I didn\'t anticipate on day one Frank would immediately try and figure out and partially succeed in finding\na way to beat the system. Like everything else though,\nthey quickly caught on, and now on some mornings, I\'ll catch them just waiting\nfor the daily ration, chilling patiently on the bench seat, that is, everyone but Phantastic Gus. Don\'t ever change, buddy. When I started this\ntwo-month-long adventure trying to bird-watch, I had no idea I would enjoy\nsquirrel-watching so much more. It\'s also made me realize that\neven amongst the structures and pavement and power lines, how interesting nature can be\nin a single suburban backyard if you just really stop to look. Even the plants are amazing! I had no idea that as vines grow, they spin around looking\nfor something to grab onto. I didn\'t anticipate the\nwide variety of animals that use fences as inner yard highways to get around as a substitute\nfor all the trees that existed before we got here. Even little interactions like\nthis spider extending his life with this very timely leap into the unknown were\njust so delightful to see. But of all the animals, I can definitively say now that squirrels are my absolute favorite, and they\'re certainly a\nmore formidable adversary than porch pirates. They\'re kind of adorable, incredibly crafty, curious by nature, athletic, and persistent. Turns out, squirrels can\nlive to be 20 years old, and so I like to think that someday, Phantastic Gus will bring his\ngrand-squirrels to the fence and regale them with tales\nof cowboys and courage and legendary walnut piles.

How to spot a fad diet - Mia Nacamulli
Conventional wisdom about diets, including government \nhealth recommendations, seems to change all the time. And yet, ads routinely come about claiming to have the answer \nabout what we should eat. So how do we distinguish \nwhat's actually healthy from what advertisers just want us\nto believe is good for us? Marketing takes advantage of\nthe desire to drop weight fast, and be stronger, slimmer, and brighter. And in the big picture, diet plans\npromising dramatic results, known as fad diets, are just what they seem:\ntoo good to be true. So where do diet fads even come from? While the Ancient Greeks and Romans rallied behind large-scale \nhealth regimens centuries earlier, this phenomenon began in earnest\nin the Victorian Era with crazes like the vinegar diet and the Banting Diet. Since then, diets have advised us \nall sorts of things: to excessively chew, to not chew at all, to swallow a grapefruit per meal, non-stop cabbage soup, even consumption of arsenic, or tapeworms. If the idea of diet crazes \nhas withstood history, could this mean that they work? In the short term, \nthe answer is often yes. Low-carbohydrate plans, like the popular Atkins \nor South Beach Diets, have an initial diuretic effect. Sodium is lost until the body\ncan balance itself out, and temporary fluid weight loss may occur. With other high-protein diets,\nyou might lose weight at first since by restricting your food choices, you are dropping \nyour overall calorie intake. But your body then lowers \nits metabolic rate to adjust to the shift, lessening the diet's effect over time and resulting in a quick reversal\nif the diet is abandoned. So while these diets \nmay be alluring early on, they don't guarantee long-term benefits\nfor your health and weight. A few simple guidelines, though,\ncan help differentiate between a diet that is beneficial \nin maintaining long-term health, and one that only offers temporary\nweight changes. Here's the first tipoff: If a diet focuses on intensely cutting\nback calories or on cutting out entire food groups, like fat, sugar, or carbohydrates, chances are it's a fad diet. And another red flag is ritual, when the diet in question instructs you\nto only eat specific foods, prescribed combinations, or to opt for particular food substitutes, like drinks, bars, or powders. The truth is shedding pounds\nin the long run simply doesn't have a quick-fix solution. Not all diet crazes tout weight loss. What about claims of superfoods, cleanses,\nand other body-boosting solutions? Marketing emphasizes the allure of products associated with ancient \nand remote cultures to create a sense of mysticism\nfor consumers. While so-called superfoods,\nlike blueberries or açaí, do add a powerful punch of nutrients, their super transformative qualities\nare largely exaggeration. They are healthy additions \nto a balanced diet, yet often, they're marketed\nas part of sugary drinks or cereals, in which case the negative properties\noutweight the benefits. Cleanses, too, may be great in moderation since they can assist \nwith jumpstarting weight loss and can increase the number of fresh\nfruits and vegetables consumed daily. Scientifically speaking, though, they've not yet been shown to have\neither a long-term benefit or to detox the body any better than\nthe natural mechanisms already in place. Everywhere we look, we're offered solutions \nto how we can look better, feel fitter, and generally get ahead. Food is no exception, but advice on what we should eat is best\nleft to the doctors and nutritionists who are aware of our \nindividual circumstances. Diets and food fads \naren't inherently wrong. Circumstantially, \nthey might even be right, just not for everyone all of the time."

How to make healthy eating unbelievably easy | Luke Durward | TEDxYorkU
'Translator: Maurício Kakuei Tanaka\nReviewer: Adam Fitzgerald My little brother was very good at a few things\nfrom a very young age. The first thing he was really good at\nwas making everybody laugh without trying. Like the one time I told him he should have a little bit\nof protein after a workout. He got all excited\nbecause he thought I said "poutine." (Laughter) The second thing he was good at\nwas eating large quantities of food. Come dinner time, it wasn\'t uncommon for him to outeat\nmost of the adults at the table. Now, as you may have guessed, \nas a five-foot-nothing little boy, there is, in fact, a downside \nto regularly outeating full-grown men. At just 11 years old, I could already see\nthat, if nothing else changed, my little brother was headed\nfor an adolescent life littered with teasing\nand unhealthy eating. As his older brother,\nI wanted to do something about it. As a nutrition, or kinesiology student,\nwith an intense interest in nutrition, I knew that I had to do\nsomething about it. Initially, I wasn\'t sure how,\nbut I was determined to find a way. Now, in March of 2013, I broke my leg while I was\nwalking to class, and I slipped on some ice. Yes, that is the whole story. I was walking, there was some ice. Poof, broken leg. No lives saved. No purses returned. No cool story to tell. Little did I know as I lay there\nin that quickly melting puddle of ice, waiting for the ambulance to arrive, that this moment would forever \nchange the life of my little brother. After I had a surgery to attach a small titanium plate\nand a few screws onto my fibula, I was given two crutches, and told not to put any weight\non my leg for two months. This posed a unique problem, as there was still plenty\nof snow and ice on the ground. And I still had two months left of class, spread out over one of the largest\ncampuses in the country. So, with that in mind, \nI made a decision that any hard-working student \nin my position would do. And I obviously decided\nto stop going to classes. (Laughter) Now, with all this free time\nfrom studying at home, I had finally figured out\nhow I was going to help my little brother. I knew that what he needed to do\nwas very simple in theory, but very difficult in practice. What he needed to do\nwas change his eating habits. From experience I knew the things that he needed\nto change, and the things that he didn\'t. The problem was that communicating\nthis through somebody else would most likely just end up\nlike the childhood game of telephone. The message gets passed along, but with little misunderstandings\nand misinterpretations along the way. There\'s not much left\nof the original message, and everybody\'s just left confused. And my little brother\'s eating habits\nare left unchanged. So, keeping that in mind, I made\none of the best decisions of my life, and I decided to move back home\nfor the next two weeks, and make every single meal\nthat my little brother would eat, educating him about proper\nnutrition along the way. While I was at home, in the kitchen, I often found myself\nawkwardly trying to maneuver holding on to two crutches,\nhot pans, and sharp knives. It wasn\'t very easy. I also had to make sure to take\nlittle breaks every few minutes to make sure that the swelling in my ankle\nwouldn\'t become unbearable. Now, after just two weeks, not only were the results phenomenal, but they were as a result of a strategy\nthat anybody can use. The reason we were able to see\nsuch dramatic and positive results, which I\'m very excited\nto share with you later, is that we changed his environment\nto match his goal. We made his environment work for him,\ninstead of against him. This simply meant replacing\nall of the bad options with healthy ones. Making this uncomplicated adjustment enabled us to easily\ntransform his nutrition, from the standard American diet, ironically referred to\nfrom its acronym SAD, to wholesome and nutritious\nwithout a hitch. Because of the planning this\nwasn\'t the least bit difficult to do. When you remove the unhealthy options, wholesome and nutritious food\nbecomes both plan A, and plan B. The beauty of this solution is that it takes willpower\nalmost completely out of the equation. Quite simply, if it\'s not there,\nyou can\'t eat it. An added bonus to this strategy is if there\'s no chips\non the counter calling your name, it\'s likely that you\'ll just\nforget about them, and completely avoid the feeling\nof deprivation all at once. Little bit of a brain block. This may sound a little bit\ntoo simple to be true, but I assure you it\'s not. When you remove the barriers\nto your success -- in my little brother\'s case,\nunhealthy food -- and you replace, or you pave\nthe way, barrier-free, the road to success\nbecomes a much smoother ride. So set up your environment so that it works for you,\ninstead of against you. This works well for any goal. For my little brother,\nI was the environment. I made all of his food,\ngave him the right snacks, and answered all of his questions. But what would that have\nlooked like if I wasn\'t there, and how can you make this work for you? Well, to be successful, you have to minimize\nthe difficult decisions being made. Say, for example, you walk into the lobby, and, on the left of those tables,\nis delicious chocolate chip cookies, squares, and everything you like. On the right side,\nis fresh fruit and vegetables, vibrant colors, chopped up nicely,\nthey\'re crunchy and juicy. You\'ve been sitting in here\nfor two hours, so you\'re starving, you have a choice to make. Should you choose option A on the left, or should you choose the wholesome\nnutritious broccoli on the right? Given this scenario, I think it would be very hard\nfor most of us to resist the temptation of option A. This is a real-life situation, and it\'s one that happens all the time. It\'s very important,\nbecause of that reason. So when you remove\nthe barriers to your success, it will just become a little bit easier for you to not have to make\nthat hard decision in the first place. Here\'s how you can make\nthis strategy work for yourself. Start off by finding out\nwhat your personal trigger foods are, and make a promise to not keep them\nin your house anymore. So that when the time comes, the decision has already\nbeen made for you. Now, that\'s not to say you can never\nhave these foods again. If you really want one, you can always\njust go to the store, and buy one, or you can keep it so that you\'re only having them\nat special events, such as this. Just don\'t keep a stash\nunderneath the cupboard if you know that they\'re going\nto be an issue for you. That\'s how you make your environment\nwork for you, instead of against you. That\'s how you make healthy eating the default, and not the exception. So if you have a personal goal\nof eating better, go home, find all of your junk food, and a neighbor that you\'re\nnot particularly fond of, and give it all to them. The basis of this strategy worked\nfor my little 11-year-old brother, and it can certainly work for you too. Let me just finish off by sharing the final results\nof my little brother\'s lifestyle change. Let me also just point out, that I had one main rule\nthat I wanted to follow with the change. At no point, did I want my 11-year-old brother\nto feel hungry, or deprived. Here\'s how that worked out. After the first seven days,\nhe had lost five pounds. After the second week,\nit was eight pounds. But it didn\'t just stop there. I went back to write exams,\nand he kept going. After 20 days, it was ten pounds, and, by 36 days, he had averaged half a pound a day to top it off at 18 pounds lost. (Applause) [Make your environment work FOR YOU] If everybody had their environment\nworking for them, instead of against them, my little brother\'s level of success\nwould be the norm. My hope is that one day it will be. Thank you. (Applause)'
