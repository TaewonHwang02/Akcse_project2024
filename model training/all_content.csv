at the second cup in the village but I cannot have caffeine past like 11:00 a.m. so it was just a water for me after that we decided to walk around in the unseasonably warm weather and just pick some place to sit down and eat I'm going to be completely honest with you we had no idea if this place was going to be any good all we saw was a real cute looking restaurant we figured that was probably good enough and thankfully we ended up not totally regretting it and honestly if the only thing that I got on the menu that day was these peris it would have been worth it I don't know why progis aren't on menus first and foremost more often but these were superb I wish I had the words in my vocabulary to describe them and then for the main course I decided to just get some breaded fish I think this was hattic and it was also very very good 10 out of 10 I really wish I could remember the name of this place one thing about recording these videos I will say I have become acutely aware of the faces that I make when I eat my food apparently I look like I'm not enjoying myself but genuinely everything tasted amazing and I would definitely go back here if I could just at least remember the name of it after we finished eating we let our stomach settle for a little bit I stole my friend sunglasses and took plenty of pictures and videos in them her sunglasses collection by the way is amazing she gets like everything from Amazon and then it was just more exploring of that general area grabbed an water and then headed back home to make some not so light dinner but I was starving by

whilst they were in the toaster I made myself an iced coffee I used one of these sachets because I could not be asked to make actual coffee you're only meant to add water but I feel like it's just too watered down so I also added some milk too gave it a quick stir and by the time that was done my crumpets were ready so I whacked some butter on both of them and then I also added cheese on top of one of them listen don't come at me if you haven't tried cheese on a crumpit try it and then come back to me anyways I skipped lunch because I had to go and make some content but when I got back I made

really nice they're actually vegan and I was so excited about that then I had some toast with peanut butter that little slice is cuz I hate wasting like the end of the bread and I like the crust so

"How to Lose Weight and Be Fit Forever | 10 Tips

"""to lose those extra kilos to be fit forever to have a healthy relationship with food and to just feel so confident in our bodies if you desire any of these know that you're not alone so today let's talk about how to lose weight and be fit in a healthy sustainable and doable way when I was 18 I got very into nutrition and fitness I started to learn about foods and what they do to my body and pretty much got obsessed with the concept of Health being a young impressionable woman somewhere along the line and went a little too far and developed an unhealthy restrictive relationship with food which now that I look back at I'm very grateful for because that experience taught me how much of the way we look and feel is based on our mental health habits and learned behavior now many years and lessons later I feel like I've gotten to truly know my body but most importantly when it comes to food and fitness I've created a sustainable lifestyle that allows me to honor and cherish my body now before we get into the tips I just want to add a small disclaimer and say that I am not a doctor or a nutritionist or a dietitian and although I'm passionate about this topic I'm passionate about health all of these tips are coming from my own personal experience and what I've learned so always with any information you receive take that through your own heart and gut and filter it through your brain and make the necessary conclusions that you need and as I always recommend it's useful to consult your actual doctor or your actual dietitian if you have one but that being said let's get into the tips [Music] I put this as number one because I truly believe that it's the basis of everything learning about nutrition will help you understand how much you need what you need and how certain foods work in your body now what do I mean when I say learn about nutrition learn about what carbs do what protein does what fat does to your body how it works together what minerals you need all of this information will truly help you understand how to maneuver in the kitchen I would say that before all the other tips learn about the food in your fridge and understand is the food in your fridge benefiting you and what your body needs [Music] I know that nowadays this is a very difficult one and this is why I you know I'm very careful with my language I rarely use words like never or restrict but I am saying avoid just because you're more likely to eat good food when you make it from scratch you know when you cut your own vegetables when you're cooking your own meal and adding spices and ingredients that you know that you love and it's always just so much better when I say processed I think like super packaged added with like bunch of oils or sugars the types of foods also really a really good way to look at it like to kind of measure if the food is healthy or not you know those super processed breads when you look at the expiration date and it's like two or three months that is highly processed like fresh bread will go bad in a couple of days days like maybe five four days so this is just something to keep in mind remember everything is about balance and everything is kind of you have to take it through what is good for you it's much easier to lose weight in general and to be fit if you know the ingredients you're putting in and the ingredients are fresh and it's actual food tip number three learn to eat exactly how much you need obviously there will be events and times where you overeat or under eat but really learning how to eat exactly how much you need is the key to keeping and maintaining your weight extra calories that we don't need is the thing that then leads to having that extra weight having those extra kilos so learning how to not overeat and eating exactly how much you need is a very very useful skill and it's actually interesting because when I was going through kind of my health journey I was kind of introduced into this concept of like eating how much you need and I noticed when I started to kind of you know observe people because I naturally observed people that some people actually do this very naturally and this usually comes when they have been raised in a family where everyone eats how much they need they don't have this kind of mentality of finish your plate which is something I hate I think it's the worst thing you can tell to your kid because that kid will learn to eat according to what is in front of them not according to what they their body says so just be very very mindful when you're maybe overeating or if you feel like you're overeating a lot is this coming from something you have learned from your family is this coming from a place of comfort because you wanna fill something else else so think about those questions and actually this point leads me to The Next Step which is build a healthy relationship with food I have a whole video on this topic which is one of my most popular videos so apparently a lot of people love that video and I love that video so definitely check that out I go in depth about this topic and I kind of don't want to repeat myself too much because that video is really packed with information so definitely check that out I promise you literally I can promise you that by learning the things that I say in that video that will help you so much in your health Journey but in short if you learn to build a healthy relationship with your food that will help you not only physically but mentally and let's be real a lot of weight problems come from our mental issues it is a fact when we overeat when we're sad right when we binge eat like that's also a mental disorder when we we see food as kind of this entity good or bad all of this is kind of us putting moral value to food and all of this is coming from that unhealthy pattern unhealthy relationship with food so this is such an important Point again I will mention that video go check it out but first watch these tips and then check it out because when you learn how to build that relationship how to trust your body how to eat when you're hungry not when you're sad because that is something I used to suffer from when I would just eat because I was bored or sad these are patterns that I learned from my childhood so uh go check it out and let's move to the next tip at the basis of weight loss obviously is calories in versus calories out that's the basis that's something that I hope most of us know but our bodies are complex if let's say you are deficient in something or if you have some kind of a hormonal problem that can also create disbalance in your body and create different issues that can lead to weight gain test your basic you know vitamins and minerals and all of that just check if you're not deficient because when we talk about Fitness and I really want to point this out we are not just talking about looking good okay I know that this is the main reason why a lot of people clicked on this video I understand we want to lose weight to look good but at the basis of Fitness is how strong is our body inside and out now a light Next Level blood test would be kind of checking your hormonal Health which is you know I've been thinking about this a lot but that's for a different video and this is I think especially important for women being in disbalance like hormonal this balance can cause different things skin issues gut problems the list goes on and remember that for you to be in a healthy good weight your gut health is so important because that will result in result in how good you absorb vitamins and all of that and actually on that note I read a quote recently that I really really loved and it said you are not what you eat you are what you absorb and I love that because all of us have heard that you know you are what you eat I heard it all my life but I love this new Twist on it because it doesn't matter what you eat it matters what you actually absorb you know that's who you are do the blood tests take care of your body and I promise you that that will also give you more clarity on what you need to eat what vitamins you need to take and how you can take care of your body veggies veggies veggies most adults don't eat enough vegetables and it makes so much sense because again going back to the previous points I mentioned so much food is processed and packaged and most of that food does not contain that much vegetables it contains a lot of oils and sugars and carbs and and and bread and all of that I promise you you can't overeat on veggies like you would have to be a very special individual to overeat on veggies I mean you know let's not go overboard but when I say veggies veggies veggies fill your plate with different colorful vegetables and instead of seeing vegetables as a side dish try to sometimes make dishes where veggies are the main dish and then put some you know protein or or carb on the side because veggies are just so good like I like that's how I feel that's why I made a whole point of it veggies are also low calorie which is really really helpful when you want to try to lose weight always combine it of course with some protein and don't don't go to kind of the other spectrum and start eating just broccoli all day okay please don't be that person you obviously need to eat a variety of foods to stay healthy if all you eat currently are very calorie dense meaty cheesy Foods you will be surprised how much you will benefit if you replace one meal a day or one snack a day with you know some colorful veggie mix and also you can make it so interesting you can add it in soups you can make different dips it's just like I'm gonna stop here otherwise this video is gonna turn into like me obsessing over vegetables but I love them so much especially in winter time I load up on veggies I love veggies so that's my tip in your weight loss Journey if you replace or even add a lot of veggies to your plate I promise you you will see a lot of a lot of beautiful differences in the way you feel and in the way you look foreign now the reason why I say whatever way you like is because this whole video this whole idea of Being Fit or losing weight is also about sustainability it does nothing good for you to start running 10 miles or deciding that you will run 10 miles every day but then completely burning out and getting tired and exhausted and stopping after four days and then having this kind of hateful relationship towards exercise and movement and then not wanting to move at all it does nothing good so I always encourage people to find the type of movement that they love some like swimming some like dancing some like running or walking I have found in my life personally that what keeps me motivated and wanting to exercise is switching it up I have had years where I go religiously to gym then I had a big moment of running I actually still love running but that's something I'm not able to do physically right now then I now have these walking Spurs I also stretch and do a little bit of yoga I keep it interesting and I keep it fun and what motivates me is thinking about when I'm old and I hope this will motivate you as well obviously we will all age and get old but you can't prolong your kind of Youth by moving your body and it will also help you to be more fit it will help your gut health and your heart and at the end of the day if we're talking about weight loss that is the thing that will help you burn calories if you're a person who hates exercising I would really maybe evaluate what it is that you hate about it and trying to understand is there anything that you do enjoy and uh think about if someone in your life has maybe minimized what you love in movement because that can sometimes create that feeling of it's not worth it and I want to go back to walking because walking is such a good example it's something we've heard a lot that walking does nothing really it's not as effective as I don't know weight lifting or running and that's just not true walking is a form of exercise and it is low impact and by low impact that means that it is just nice and easy for your body and it's something that everyone can do and this is why I recommend walking to you in case you still don't know what form of exercise you enjoy walking is something that everyone does and it is so doable and it's still a form of movement and then you know from there you can explore maybe you want to do a little run here and there maybe you want to do some I don't know dancing it doesn't matter just move your body it will move everything inside of you mentally emotionally and physically this is actually something that I started to religiously pay attention to a couple of years ago when I read a book about sleeping and how chronically sleep deprived people are and this kind of changed a lot in me we will all have instances where we don't sleep enough it's life sadly but this is something you should be striving for there are many many studies you can look it up you can Google it or research it that show that sleep deprived people are more prone to weight gain and I think there are different factors for this but I can actually speak from my own personal experience when I was working night shifts when I was still in uni I was working at a casino I you know I would sleep a little bit during the morning and then I would study during the day and work through the nights and I felt so exhausted not only in a physical sense which obviously is the case because I wasn't sleeping but also emotionally that sweets and sugar gave me that energy and I kept eating all of the that junk food a lot to kind of keep myself going so this is just one aspect of sleep deprivation you will then find sources where you can gain that energy and in the end your body won't recover properly like it should during sleep and it a lot of will go down and disbalances will happen and all of that because you're not giving yourself the basic function of sleep so pay attention in your life if you're trying to lose weight and to be more fit are you sleeping those seven to eight hours and I'm being very generous when I say seven to eight because the book actually says minimum eight minimum eight uh and there are so many studies that show the difference even between six hours a night and eight hours an hour night how much clearer your head is how more like your energy level levels are sufficient so there are many many many benefits so remember sleep sleep as a fellow stress addict I understand how difficult it might be to hear those words but uh sadly it is true you're more prone to weight gain and all sort of health problems if you stress to be honest stress is kind of a human killer for everything really it brings all sorts of diseases so why wouldn't it bring also weight gain it does just horrible stuff now stress is actually good for humans you know it was designed for a purpose it was designed for us to I don't know escape a bear if a bear comes our way and to really focused so stress is needed but the problem is nowadays because we don't have any bears to escape unless you live in the woods and Escape Bears every day that's very stressful I feel for you because we don't have all these problems we now find stress in absolutely everything and before we know it it's kind of become a part of functions now when we stress our cortisol level spikes when our cortisol level spikes there are different functions in our body that kind of slows down maybe that's why you've noticed that when you stress kind of your your tummy can hurt or you can feel a little bit off especially women if you go through stress a lot your reproductive system gets affected you lose a period or your period is now late all of this can come from that stress so obviously the way you eat the way you process food the way your hormones work all of that can be affected which can then lead to weight gain some of the things that have helped me a lot is going on walks very very good for your mental health meditation gratefulness like writing in a gratitude journal or just being grateful and then also an approach that is very random but has helped me a lot is saying it there are some things where if you learn how to say just it you really learn to believe it and you understand how many insignificant things there are in your life that you stress about and it's hard at first but once you learn these I promise you that it becomes easier and easier and your body will only thank you if you learn how to be at peace [Music] is the most important tip of all I know I say that about all of the tips but I feel like this is a good way to end these there's no point in doing anything dieting or eating a certain food or exercising if it doesn't lead to sustainable lifestyle or results this is why this video is called how to lose weight and be fit forever you can only be fit forever if you find a lifestyle that for you is doable forever let's say you hate a certain vegetable if you hate that vegetable but you keep eating it because you've read that somewhere it's a good vegetable I promise you you will either live a very miserable life because you're eating something that you hate or two you will quit very fast it's the same with quick fix diets this is why I don't believe in them that's why I don't stand behind them even a little bit they do not work you have to ask yourself do I just want to lose weight in I don't know a week or do I want to look in this way like in my ideal weight and be in my ideal weight and look the way I want to and love forever and I think most of us will answer forever so you have to understand and kind of look through what are the little habits and things you can do that for you is sustainable and forever this is what is sustainable for me currently way in my life I eat primarily what I would say are healthy Whole Foods I love and I have learned actually to love them so also remember that a lot of things you can learn to love I have found the spices that I love I eat good food I cook a lot because I love to cook I drink a lot of water I think that's kind of we all know that you need to drink water and I move my body every single day I stay away from sugar and sugary drinks because I just know that they are bad for me but that being said when I go out or if I'm in a party I will have a drink I will eat ice cream and crisps and chocolates when there's an event I don't restrict anything to myself because I have found that that wouldn't be sustainable when I restrict I immediately want that food so I don't restrict I just prioritize Health in my life I have formed a lifestyle that for me is sustainable a lifestyle that I know that I will be able to do for the rest of my life I want to quickly tell you a little story I actually thought for the most of my life that I Am Naturally very skinny and I'm probably there's definitely genetics but I think about eight nine months I accidentally noticed that I gained about two kilograms which is four pounds and again it might seem like it's not a lot lot but for a slim person for a skinny person that's actually you know it's it's like unexpected or it seems like a lot when I analyzed it I immediately knew that it wasn't a random thing I never think that these things are random it was because my lifestyle changed um I don't want to go into it way too much like there are different videos where I talk about this where I was just tired I was tired and overworked and I ate a lot of junked and so I gained a little bit of weight but the minute I went back to my lifestyle the way it just kind of went off and that's because I have found things that work for me now we can always be healthier and we can always be less healthy so this is not about comparison this is all about finding and understanding what little things you can do in your life and just a final tip I feel like I keep saying and another tip don't try to do everything at once if you're like me this will overwhelm you and you will quit everything I got here today with the healthy habits I have not in one day okay this is years this is I formed a relationship with all of this so try to implement tiny things that seem to you sustainable maybe everything that I mentioned to you does not sound sustainable that is fine find something that is sustainable and doable to you and a bonus tip number 11 I bet you didn't expect that is stay away from sugary drinks and drink water instead I always think that sugary drinks are a waste of calories like I would rather eat my calories because they don't really give you satiety but you still consume calories such as it's just a waste of calories Gus loves sugary drinks and I always try to like say to him like maybe limit a little bit and he's like nah I don't care I love my sugar drinks but that's just a bonus tip if you want to try to lose weight I think that's probably one of the best and easy tips to kind of include because that doesn't take away like that love you have maybe for unhealthy foods but if you just take out the drink that's already like you know you're taking out a lot of calories from that so if you can learn to love water I love water with lemon that's just that's just it's perfect I'm wishing you all the luck in your weight loss fitness and health journey I know how personal it is to each and every one of us and remember that no one else will understand what exactly you're going through except you so trust yourself and love yourself I know it's so cheesy I used to think it's so cheesy to say that but it's so important because you will make much better decisions about health and food when it's coming from a pace pace I ruined it I ruined such a beautiful sentence from a pain from a place of love thanks again for watching and I will see you next time bye [Music]""

always I've been eating really healthy for the past week so I deserve this okay mmm mmm it's so moist and there's like sure on the bottom there [Music] okay so next I have the jelly filled donut that one looks really good I love Jerico donuts this is what it looks like when they take a bite these donuts are like different than regular Donuts these alike really gourmet look at that [Music] the raspberry filling literally tastes like I got fresh raspberries swish them and made them into like this delicious Jam [Music] it's raining outside feels like a really gloomy rainy day and I love it it's such a great day for a cheat day that's what I usually want to eat when it's like cold and rainy when it's hot I'm not like that hungry I'm gonna eat the lemon bar that I got this lemon bar so good okay first bite this is so good it's like really good pie crust and then there's lemon it's like tangy and sweet it's not too tangy though [Music] because I feel so relaxed right now chillax has anyone said diet like ten years [Music] so smokin okay so my sweet tooth is not that big like I really prefer salty and like pickled foods way more I mean obviously I love sweet stuff and eye candy all the time but I can't eat that much sugar and one go like I don't know how some people just eat like a whole cake in one go I could never so right now I'm gonna go get something to satisfy that salty tooth it's not a thing [Applause] [Music] I got back home the grocery store was hectic because it's Super Bowl Sunday so I just grabbed some stuff and I got out of there as quick as possible even though that was like an hour it's 124 right now you're probably wondering where Harrison is he's actually sleeping he just went to bed right now because he spent all night writing an essay and

"""Hey, good morning. Are you ready to spend the day at the farm\nwith me? You are what you eat. It's just a fact. But it doesn't mean that in my household we\ndon't have pizzas flying around sometimes or hamburgers. You know, I have kids and they love their\nstuff. But I also think that as a Mom, we lead by\nexample, so I continue to do all my organic, healthy stuff. You know I like to start my morning with a\nglass of lemon water. So it's very simple. You take a half lemon. I'm the queen of lemons. Just because they have so many health benefits. It alkalizes the gut. It's cleansing. It has a lot of nutrients in it, so it's just\na great way to start your morning. You know I don't really drink coffee. I love matcha with goat milk, so I usually\ndo that, but always maybe like 15 minutes after I have my lemon water. Mmm. Yummy. After my lemon water, I do oatmeal. Just because it's easy. It's quick. Really gives you great energy to get through\nyour morning. And then I really think that we don't have\nenough fat anymore in our diet, so I always put a little bit of organic butter with this\ncute little butter dish that Gigi made when she was maybe like 8 years old. I like to put a little bit of almonds on it. Just add a little protein. Then I like to use different fruits. Right now I'm into strawberries just because\nit's very low in sugar. Sometimes I put organic honey. But then I also like to use stevia. And if you can get used to the taste, I think\nit's a much better and healthier choice than white sugar. You know, I really love breakfast. There's something about it. It's a moment where I give gratitude to my\nbeautiful life and having this amazing food--organic food in front of me. And you know I love looking outside and seeing\nthe cows, the geese and the connection with nature. I also think it's important to take your time\nto eat breakfast. You know you can do it in ten minutes. It doesn't need to be an hour. But just this moment where you just check\nin with yourself before you start your day. So for lunch I always like to have a salad\nand some sort of protein. Today I'm going to do a arugula salad. I like to make a curry chicken with some grapes\nin it, some onions. It's just boiled organic chicken and I put\nthe curry and mayo and onions and celery and all that stuff. I do like it on top of my arugula salad. This combination of brussels sprouts, some\ncranberries. A little bit of that on it and then just a\nlittle bit of dressing that I made with olive oil, honey, a little vinegar. I'm really loving going to the Farmer's Market\nand see what's available in this season and use that in my kitchen. A little bit of salt and pepper and that to\nme, is just the perfect lunch. So my favorite afternoon little snack, a little\npick me up, is a goat milk, which I use preferably, because it's so much easier to digest than\nregular milk. And you just boil a cup. I'm obsessed with cardamom and cinnamon and\nI boil that, stir it. It's just a wonderful little afternoon pick\nme up. And then I sweeten it with honey. Mmm, I love it. We use cardamom in lemon cake. We use cardamom in goat milk and my kids love\nit, because their Grandmother, in the Arab kitchen, they use a lot of cardamom, so they\nkind of learned it there. It's just a wonderful afternoon pick me up. So I like to make my dinner my lightest meal\nof the day, only because I go to sleep very early so it doesn't give you much time to\ndigest anything else. So I love to do any kind of soup. I make it easy and start with an organic chicken\nbroth, just for the flavor. You know you can obviously put in your vegetable\njuice, whatever you like. I love putting chopped garlic. I put my chopped carrots, onions of course. I mean best thing to flavor. Celery. And then a little bit of zucchini, which is\nalso great for flavor. Salt and pepper. I like to use Himalayan salt just because\nthere are so many great minerals in there. Add a little bit more carrot. Little baby gale. Baby, baby gale. Little baby gale. Little baby kale. I don't cook it too long because I don't want\nto overcook it. So you wait until it boils. So this is Bragg's natural yeast. And I love the flavor of that. When the girls come home late from work, soup\nis amazing because it digests so fast, because it's obviously boiled. But on a proper night, when everybody is home\non time, they love their spaghetti bolognese, garlic bread, salad. But this will do, you know, for a late dinner. You know I take such great pride in being\na homemaker. I think that when you have children, as a\nMom, I want them to keep coming home as long as possible and by providing a home that feels\nlike an anchor, a place where we can talk about memories and make new memories. We cook, we have a glass of wine and\nI think that's what life is all about at the end of the day. So I'm just going to leave this on the stove\nfor about 30 minutes, 30 - 40 minutes and then you have the perfect light dinner. I'm going to let this cool down. I think it's the perfect time to make a fire. So this is really my favorite part of the\nday. I just made this fire myself. Don't you agree--I'm becoming a really good\nEast Coast girl. Thank you for spending the day with me. And see you later. Ciao.""

"""Good morning! This is Teddy. I'm Miranda. Do you want to come spend the day with me? So one of my favorite things to have first thing in the morning is hot water with lemons. It's a really great way to kind of kickstart your digestion. It's full of Vitamin C. Cheers! After I've made my hot water and lemon I'll then make a smoothie and these are some of my favorite ingredients to include. Almond milk. Fresh papaya. Spinach. Blueberries and raspberries. Almond butter. It's a great source of protein. And then last but not least. I add my little Kora Organics skin food supplements. So this contains noni. It contains acai. Blueberry. Matcha green tea. I used to drink it as a liquid but this is so much easier. It's nutritious and delicious. Delicious. This is one of Flynn's favorite things to have for breakfast. I like it 'cause they're healthy for him and he likes it 'cause they're really yummy. It contains a free range egg. Oatmeal and a little banana. Put them all in a blender. Now just turn this on. Add a little coconut oil. Make little mini pancakes. I'm just going to let the dog out for a second. Who let the dogs out! Who who who. Go ahead out. Sometimes I use two of these to get underneath there. So as you can see super quick and easy to make. And I'll add a couple of little raspberries. A little coconut nectar. It's important to do exercise that you really enjoy. For me, I really enjoy yoga. Just doing a few stretches and yoga poses, really helps me feel really energized and grounded and ready for the day. So for lunch I'm going to have salmon. with a little crushed garlic turmeric and fresh lemon with a side salad of sprouts and arugula cucumber, purple cauliflower, and avocado. And then I make a simple salad dressing with olive oil, lemon a little apple cider vinegar and a little sea salt. No matter how busy I am, I really try to take a moment and just really be present wiht eating and really enjoy my food. Hello? You know, I work all over the world and I do have an office at Kora Organics but it's nice when I get to have those days where I work from home because I get to to cook for myself and cook for the family. I know they really enjoy that and so do I. So one of my favorite meals to cook is my slow roast chicken. I add, onion, garlic, fresh lemon, turmeric, rosemary. I put it in the oven, it cooks for 7 hours. and then I have that with sweet potato mash. I just leave the skin on and you just pop them in to steam. So this is one of my favorite salads, it's super simple. We have cabbage here with baby spinach parsley, a little cilantro finely chopped cucumber, olives halloumi cheese, sunflower seeds pine nuts and celery. Bon appetit! Thank you so much for joining me today. I really hope you enjoy my recipes. Now you'd better get going 'cause I have to have dinner with my family. Go on. Get! Go on! Bye!""

this or it's already stirred I stirred it and then you take like each bite with a little bit of peanut butter okay here goes nothing I don't even know how to do it you do it bite by bite this is like a dessert what early how do you eat this every morning you're so sweet I'm just in bit I'm so excited for the next morning no mm-hmm I mean I think it's really good but it was very sweet how's yours over there salty it's gonna bring but I mean it's not bad I mean salty yeah what's your other like typical breakfast like if you're not doing this if you're like on so sugar you know me okay avocado toast what does that it mmm or a nasty bow that's evil there's a good one somewhere around here but I had recently and I want to try them the back here Bulls have you been there apparently those ones are very good mm-hmm so live organics mm-hmm it's very good so life is really good yeah yeah I want to go there again I have a really nice one in Malibu okay so wait you put just oh yeah have you been doing no meet yeah hopefully it doesn't say so I'm not sure how much meat you're gonna give me today but you don't have to eat it all honestly a really great sir who's right hmm and that keeps you full Farrell along with us the oats are just like very slow it's like carbohydrates don't for me to swallow it stuck yeah it's gonna sit in your stomach like a like a stone like a weight yeah sometimes I even make some open up through it so it gets like a little less sick liquor no milk and good any cuts no no okay look how could you get there but Lawrence also hates it he's like I hate to taste a protein what is he to sweet breakfast eater it's something like this or like his oatmeal but then without anything in it like plain and I find oatmeal without any protein like super boring I don't discuss things like Carr told me did you put anything on the toast butter um I haven't had dairy in a while as well I'm gonna have energy for the workout it would honestly take me like an hour to finish all this because it's so thick yeah that's true but honestly it is really good I just don't know if I could do it every day every other day and maybe a little less do you ever put any other type of fruit in here um I love blueberries but sometimes I do like outer berries hey Mookie are you hungry too maybe mommy has something for you mmm she likes a bacon oh you like the bacon hmm help you Oh snorts when she bites it mm-hmm so today we're going to do doc phones mm-hmm are we working out with Yeti Oh perfect I've never worked out with him but you said he was um he's really good and like using your own body weight so what should we work out you do like full body your legs you know what to do mmm I'm saying full body okay that's good I haven't done any weights for a little bit we might take a look in your fridge oh there's a cake in there I can already predict what's in there probably energy drink mm-hmm that the blue one Red Bull no the one in the orange with the orange like top you always have Gatorade yeah then maybe there's some eggs bacon and water mmm maybe Red Bull no I don't know if you're doing red bull Bullard I think protein drinks hmm I think that's pretty much it I think it's gonna be fairly empty yep I only grocery shop when I have like having friends over or something that I'm like forced to go to the store and if otherwise I just order it or we go out to eat most of the time what's your favorite thing to orient toward rté my close mates yeah pop pop eyes I never had pop eyes oh my god it's so good but it's so far otherwise I would have taken you today what is it like chicken fried chicken have fried chicken but what's really good it's like these spicy tenders amazing YUM yeah I love it but they're very spicy not very spicy you could also get like regular one okay I mean if I feel like you like the peanut butter I've basically just been in the corner like this eating new fear brother no I like it I like it I like it [Music] so we're heading to the duck pond to do a workout because to have a talk on Hannah laying out it's actually a really nice one it's super epic and I think we're gonna do a full body workout and yeah that's where we're gonna do so that's good oh I kind of Miss Sofia sure that we had like the show I know where towards yeah because wants to show was there I was so nice ooh I know the show would have been what yesterday yeah yeah yesterday I would have been so fit yeah I was like I went to the gym yesterday I was like you know on earth to PS show yes I'm going to the gym right yeah I should have done that because this here is very different compared to last year's yeah hopefully one day yeah I hope so Jim I really honestly don't like people keep this [Music] I do feel like after workout I have more energy that sometimes I'm very like tired in the morning maybe because I went out or something yeah and then like I have to go work out I don't want to but I know that if I move my body now I'll feel energized that I think the first like hardest step is like getting yourself to like a minute and then in a warm-up I'm like why do I always have to go through those first 10 to 15 minutes and then what's a minute I'm like alright did you ever drink like um coffee or much or anything before you workout like a caffeine boost so I never do coffee coffee it makes me super jittery and like I get like a headache after drinking I wasn't to like lattes for a little bit Oh like addicted to it for maybe like a month and then I started just feeling too jittery also because I don't eat much breakfast when I do eat yeah I think and then I tried matcha and I was obsessed with matcha for sometime and they say they do you don't get the jitters but I still get really jittery I have to just be really careful even like if I drink Coke or something with any sort of like super sensitive form is so sensitive so I kind of don't drink anything maybe sometimes I'll have like a English breakfast tea in the morning if I need like to really wake up but I put like a lot of milk in it so that it dilutes it a bit yeah yeah I'm so sensitive to caffeine like when I have too much mantra I get jittery - yeah but I love the taste you switched tomorrow right yeah okay coffee anymore no I feel like coffee gets me like a lot of energy and then I crash and like macho's more spread through the whole day [Music] [Music] [Music] I mean I'm looking at this menu now and I'm trying to see anything that like I would order two things on my mind but you're gonna hate so it's perfect that I'm gonna hate I'm gonna hate it but I never order it okay I don't think I'm very hungry yeah I got like like Jasmine hungry I already to read it ginger shut because that's the stuff that I do yeah yeah dude like that or no I throw it in my water actually the whole thing [Applause] like that yeah purpose do you use all the every time at lunch sure yeah wait this restaurant is completely vegetarian right yeah it is yeah I never got a vegetarian restaurant so I've been really hard time deciding I don't think I could honestly I don't think I could ever go vegetarian no no I like I love like chicken and meat so much but they has bad as I feel for like I just I crave it but then it is really good stop they're really tasteless still I have to do one day where I like go and like try it and no one tells me that it's not real good because I think it's also mental thing oh yeah I'm gonna try it I'm too hard timers like assisting two o'clock if I give up because avocado walk is amazing I like it also when it's a little bit spicy do you like cilantro because I feel like people don't like it or they feel no no and now they put like micro cilantro on everything micro yeah then you can take it off and it ruins honestly i start saying when I go to restaurants that I'm allergic to cilantro because they put it on everything urgent it's probably in this ginger so I'm not worrying as long as no cilantro okay I know what I'm get you want to tell me where you're gonna order me no it's wait till we order okay I feel like it's gonna be a bowl that you're gonna give me so I'm ordering full you know what is it oh she said it's her favorite so I mean we're ordering each other's nails and we totally different so yeah alright it's the whole day you are gonna have the chimichanga but it's a chimichanga so big fried burrito No then I can't walk him to yes good luck all right it was either that or the huevos rancheros yeah that's what I would eat well then I'm happy with that chimichanga [Music] and you know I would like it if it was popped oh yeah that's really good it looks good it's not bad not without the cilantro without the cilantro it looks pretty good thank you that is you're gonna die I'm gonna die but am I gonna be I'm gonna be eating in Jasmine proportions yeah eat like me so I will eat like that much of it taking this cilantro up so these days for camellia man so I feel a little like I give you a little bit of avocado yeah all right you're gonna be parting on [Music] yeah so I can't be very good yeah it looks amazing that's right okay it works out I am proof yay I wonder what this is in there potatoes a little spicy you don't like spicy spicy I'm not used to it are you surprised I love spicy food yeah I like I like to add a little bit more no more a little bit more ok let's

"Trying the Victoria Secret Model Diet for 7 days (HARD!!!)
",1
"""hello everyone so for today's video i'm gonna be eating like seven different victoria secret models for seven days [Music] i have been eating super super super unhealthy lately for example i had m m's and chips for dinner yesterday it's been really bad i haven't worked on three months let me tell you i have gained so much weight in the past few months and i feel like [\xa0__\xa0] i'm always tired and cranky and all that so i'm gonna be trying this diet see if it's gonna work um seems pretty hard because i'm a sugar addict i'm sophia i'm addicted to sugar 22 years old i have a severe problem i crave it every second and the not a lot of sugar at all if any it was at this moment that he knew he [\xa0__\xa0] up um so for day one the first model that i'm gonna eat like is stella maxwell she is beautiful like stunning let's go let's do this let's eat like so maxwell so this is some of the food i got from mostly trader joe's for example there's like a lot of veggies lots and lots of salmon hummus almond butter almond milk avocados granola i noticed that they ate a lot of eggs like scrambled eggs in the morning so i got a lot of eggs some blueberries got like a whole roasted chicken because i'm a lazy [\xa0__\xa0] and i'm not about to like be cooking like slow roasted chicken all day so here's breakfast we just have two scrambled eggs and half an avocado and i'm gonna put some everything but the bagel seasoning on it because it's really good i'm also gonna be drinking a whole bottle of these a day because they drink so much water they're always like hydrate so yeah i'm gonna have to sell maxwell's favorite snack to munch on which are the crunchy peas lunch is ready i got salmon salad and some lemon to squeeze on the lemon on the salmon and another one of stella's favorite snack is almonds so i had a handful of almonds for dinner we had some rotisserie chicken and a big salad also we just started watching game of thrones it's really good so far i know we're really related to the game but whatever it's day two today we will be eating like victoria's secret angel romy stridged she's absolutely gorgeous stunning cute adorable and what's awesome about her is she has her own youtube channel and i can actually follow exactly what she eats in a day so that's gonna be sick for breakfast she said she had this chia pudding so i have chia seeds almonds blueberries almond milk and protein so this is breakfast it looks interesting i don't know if i'm gonna like this i'm gonna try a spoonful for lunch we went to a cute little shop and got an acai bowl i got goji berries on mine and harrison got like a peanut butter banana one he's doing this diet with me because he's a really sweet boy and he's really nice i love acai bowls they're so good and tasty and i wish i can have them for lunch every day to be honest they're really tasty and i think they're healthy i don't know so romy says she used to have like five to six or seven coffees a day and she's trying to cut back so i'm just gonna have a black coffee i don't drink coffee at all like ever just gonna try to see if it's good and scared try it well don't burn yourself we're like going across tastes like ass it tastes like um poison so this is romy's lunch that she had in her video couscous green beans cabbage salmon avocado yum yum yum yum looks so good i can't wait to try it for day three i'm gonna be eating like miranda kerr so she actually has a video on youtube where she explains what she eats in a whole day and she says that she gets star in the morning with some hot water and lemon and that it boosts the immune system and the metabolism or whatever then i had her delicious breakfast smoothie that had almond milk almond butter spinach mango blueberries and raspberries he had papaya in hers but i literally think papaya tastes like vomit so i'm just gonna stick with mango for this one lunch was a basic [\xa0__\xa0] salmon and salad dinner was sweet potato mash and chicken and then a nice big salad with halloumi cheese so can we take a moment to look at miranda cruz portion size is like it's day four today i thought i'd give you guys like a little update i'm feeling actually really good like i thought the diet would be really hard and i would be like no i need snacks i need candy because like usually i always eat candy or chocolate or something sweet but for some reason this really satisfies me i don't know i think the calories are literally just enough for me i don't feel hungry i don't feel like too full i feel like just right you know at the end of the day i'm not starving i'm not stuffed but i'm good you know but anyways today we will be eating like kendall jenner let's see how she eats you guys for breakfast she says she likes to have avocado toast and scrambled eggs this was actually really good and tasty and i liked it a lot i'm editing right now and i'm feeling a little peckish so kendall jenner says for snack she tends to have hummus and raw veggies so here we have carrots orange bell peppers and cucumber so that was good good snack lunch was chicken and rice i also like to put some salad dressing in my rice okay don't knock it till you try it's actually really good thank me later apparently kendall jenner likes to make this fettuccine and peas pasta apparently that's like the only thing she likes to make apart from her scrambled eggs so i'm going gonna be making that for dinner today here i have fettuccine onion garlic peas a little bit of salt pepper parmesan and lemon ready it looks pretty good actually what do you think was it good on day five i like jasmine tooks it started out really good until i got really hungry and craved carbs so i left over kendall jenner's pasta from the night before oops my bad sorry not sorry for jason excited like lindsey ellingson it was actually really nice but at this point i was feeling really like deprived of junk food so it was kind of hard to be honest hello today is the last day of the victoria secret diet it's been really good i'm gonna give you guys like the whole scoop how much weight i lost if it's worth it if it's good all that stuff at the end of the video but right now for the last day we're going to be eating like beautiful model bella deed melody is an interesting one because you know how all the other models eat pretty like healthy and low calorie well i found an article bella hadid talking about what she eats and this is what she said quote unquote right now my diet is pizza so recently that's all i've been eating i promise you look like every day or burgers french fries grilled cheeses i promise you guys she does not eat like that every day i mean i understand being really naturally skinny and being able to eat like that but bella used to look like this and now she looks like this so it's kind of obvious she's dieting really hard and working out extra hard and she's not eating grilled cheeses every day trust me guys but that kind of makes us believe like why can't we eat burgers and fries every day and look like that because like no one can i'm sorry but no one can eat burgers and fries every day look like that it's just not a thing it won't happen don't try it it's not a good way to lose weight or get fit but props to bella there's an updated version of what she said she likes to eat in a day and i'm going to show you guys next so let's go for breakfast bella said she usually has an egg sandwich on a plain bagel but i'm an onion bagel kind of girl i will not go for the plain so onion it is we just got our juices i don't know if i've ever had a green juice before in my life this one has kale romaine cucumber apple and mint sounds toaster so this one has cbd hemp and ginger so it's a ginger shot so bella hadid says that she likes to drink a ginger shot when she feels bad i don't know which one should we try first the the ginger shot i think it's the ginger shot because i don't want that to be the last thing in my mouth supposed to just down the whole thing at once yeah it's like a shot like shake rattle and roll okay shake we're out of the roll okay cheers cheers [Music] it's getting better the hell was that and then it got good i feel like i had a good thing curry i want one i want another one yeah oh that cbd made me feel so chill so is this not a meme is this real that's a real cheers cheers to that we like go bella now we're gonna try the green juice see how it is that smells nice smells very refreshing it smells like cucumber it's so good it's good that's so good pretty good it's not it's not that good junior shot was like mean it's kind of gross a little bit like i like it but then i hate it what about you it's all right like something about it it's like unsettling i don't know what it is i actually like the ginger shot better than this it was like spicy it felt like it was like helping my immune system oh my white blood cells oh yes oh my immune system is thanking me right now my circulatory system oh yeah yeah oh thanks for tuning in for a juice review lunch was kind of gross to be honest i had leftover rotisserie chicken and whatever veggies i could find in the fridge don't recommend then for dinner i had delicious pepperoni pizza bella hadith's favorite you can find like literally pictures of her eating pepperoni pizza like everywhere it's like insane this is me enjoying pizza after a long time of trying to be healthy i really really really really enjoyed it it was really good yum yum yum so i finished the victoria's secret diet what did i think let's talk about price people would generally think that eating like that and buying salmon and like fresh vegetables and organic stuff is really expensive but honestly if you're just getting those foods and cutting out all the junk you would get it's actually the same price or even cheaper for me at least we spent actually less money at the grocery store eating like that and we had breakfast lunch and dinner for two people for an entire week and it was cheaper because usually we go to the store we buy all these like gummies and ice creams and all that like snack stuff and like microwavable food that goes in like three days and we spent like so much money second are the calories enough i'm 5'4 so i think like to lose weight that's a good amount of calories for me let's talk about cravings as you guys know i'm a sugar addict we all know that for the first three days i was eating like salmon and all that stuff and it really satisfied me at first but then um i think it was kendall's day i had that like pasta that she made and that kind of threw me off i was like okay that's really good like then the next day i screwed up and then i was like really craving sugar and all that at least have some fruit on you because they don't need a lot of fruit but i recommend adding fruit to this diet if you like sugar as much as me just so you can satisfy yourself or did i lose weight yes i actually did lose weight i lost almost three pounds in a week which is pretty freaking good so five do i feel good actually i do i feel a lot better more energized my stomach is less bloated i wake up with a flat belly whose diet did i like the best honestly i really like stella maxwell's miranda curse and romy's those were really good i really like the salmon in the salad that's something i'm definitely going to be putting in my diet i'm really hypocritical because i just did this diet and now i'm about to go have a cheat day so that'll be up so go check that out but yeah um i'm not going to consider this a diet this is kind of a lifestyle change so i'm going to be implementing these meals in my daily life it's not really going to be a diet i'm not going to count the calories or anything i'm just going to be eating more salmon veggies if i'm hungry i'm just going to snack on like veggies and hummus like kendall jenner and i'm not going to bring out like a whole thing of chips so little things like that you don't necessarily have to diet to eat like this this is just a healthy lifestyle change and i feel like if you want to be healthy this is a pretty good diet except not valerie's because she eats grilled cheeses and pizza every day i guess no anyways guys thank you so much for watching my video i'm so happy that you're here i hope you guys enjoyed it i'll see you guys in my next video bye oh don't forget to like and subscribe bye""

for my run after i finish this so i'm going to save the mcgriddles and the other deliciousness for breakfast but i have to get these hashbrowns oh [Music] nothing hits like mcdonald's house brands [Music] all right everybody well our hot chocolate our caramel macchiato assorted donuts and four hash browns are done so it's about 7 18 right now i'm gonna go and put the tall calories consumed right up there total macros will be right up there as well i mentioned it earlier but i do have a restaurant challenge planned for later so that along with the fact that i got to eat 50 000 calories today there's a lot of stuff i got to manage up here okay but i'm gonna try to pace myself to the best i can now that that's out of the way i gotta get my health and fitness on the run is all done now i'm gonna be attempting to eat 50 000 calories today there's no way i'm going to be burning 50 000 calories so that's why i'm getting all of my activity out of the way as early in the day as possible now that that's all done it's time for breakfast number two this is the breakfast of champions normally i try to stay away from liquid calories during my calorie challenges but today all that went out the window high calorie shakes are an essential when you're trying to consume 50 000 calories in 24 hours the other essentials are peanut butter and nutella and another much needed essential for this challenge coconut oil lots of coconut oil blend all that up with some hershey syrup and ladies and gentlemen you've got three entire days worth of calories that you can pour directly into three of your favorite cups [Music] all right everybody so we got everything assembled and ready to go just so you guys know what time it is it's about 10 20 july 15th we have mcgriddles we have these pancake hot pockets right here and a mashup cereal i've never tried before just came out and of course we have these epic shakes right here i just got to say right now i'm definitely going to be making use of my blender for for what i've got going on today because i'm definitely gonna need to get in a lot of calories pretty sure these three shakes right here between five to six thousand calories apart from that i got my coffee right here just in case i need it and also some milk anyways everyone i'm ready to get this started i'm gonna go ahead and put the total calories for this meal right up there for you all and total macros will be right over there as well it's time for meal number two i think we're gonna start with our hot pockets first but if you guys haven't already you know what you gotta do you gotta give the video a like if you happen to poop today anyways let's get started all right folks here we go three two one [Music] not bad [Music] hot pockets are down i don't know about those but i wouldn't buy them again i'd eat them again just not mine [Music] just pretend like [Music] ugh everyone it's like the cereal was liquid chocolate peanut butter [Music] this is almost too much chocolate and peanut butter i never thought i'd be thinking that but i am [Music] all right folks well for reese's puffs i'd say yeah i'm gonna say about half of those are left i love reese's puffs everybody but how much chocolate and peanut butter is in those shakes i'm gonna save half of that for another time these are some rich chicks as i eat a seven roll [Music] all right it's been completed and uh second shape is down now this is very interesting they've mashed up frosted flakes and apple jacks moment of truth here we go pleasantly surprised not bad how can you get a fire all this cereal probably wasn't the best choice this early on in the day there's another calorie challenge with her this is only the beginning [Music] zero's down all three of our shakes are down you know i picked this cadbury bar just to show some love to my european subscribers because i love you guys oh all right folks i think that's gonna wrap up meal number two i know i still have my snickers and twix over here i'm gonna save those for later i'm chocolate and peanut buttered out i'm gonna go ahead and total calories consumed right up there so far and total macroscopic so far we'll be right over there it's currently 10.56 right now like i mentioned earlier i got a restaurant challenge in a few hours but before i get to that it's time for me to get one final health and fitness session [Music] i feel like i just took a bath and reese's peanut butter cups the bike ride is down now it's time for a burger challenge how's it going we had a reservation i think it's a hall of fame burger yeah yeah yeah right at table 19 which is our main table okay sweet a few my friends actually have done this challenge before my friend natter did this and kevin ross did this i think they did it in just around 25 minutes and also rayna did this challenge i think reyna is the one that has the record for this at like 22 or 23 minutes now i'm going to show you guys this burger being made only four out of a couple hundred people have ever completed the mvp burger challenge today after about sixteen thousand calories i hope to be the fifth person this burger challenge features three massive one pound burger patties that are topped and stuffed with delicious cheese they also add in some pulled pork for extra deliciousness grilled onions and jalapeno peppers just to make things interesting and each slice of texas toast is strategically layered with garlic aioli for extra deliciousness they also add in bacon because what's a burger challenge without bacon and to add some much needed crunch to this burger they throw a ton of crispy onions on top after that step they sandwich another patty in between those crispy onions and if you're wondering at this point how this massive burger is going to be staying together you'll find out in just a few seconds to balance out the 8 000 plus calories they add some healthy vegetables to the mix and the final patty is loaded on top along with some pulled pork as someone who's done multiple burger challenges over the years the addition of the pulled pork is what made this burger challenge truly remarkable as we near the completion of the burger they load up the final layer with some jalapenos peppers and onions and then it's topped with one final slice of texas toast to keep this masterpiece from falling over they stuck it with some skewers but the secondary purpose for the skewers was for the topping some onion rings now the burger's the main challenge but we do need to get in some complex carbohydrates so they made sure to add fries on the side and just like that ladies and gentlemen it's game time alright everybody so we have the mvp burger right here this is delicious looking i'm not really too sure if i want to go for speed or if i want to enjoy this one i also got some fries over here and unfortunately we have pickles i'm not the biggest fan of pickles but you know when challenges have pickles in them you got to complete the challenge so there is a 30 minute time limit on this challenge if i'm able to get this down in under 30 minutes i get the meal for free and i get a sweet t-shirt as well i also got some ranch over here and i think i'm ready to get this challenge started without further ado this is meal number three three two and one [Music] absolutely sensational so there's actually cheese inside of

does it look i can see your six-pack all right so we're gonna head back home i'm gonna take some recovery time and then get into meal four if i survive the ride now it's time to make meal number four for meal number four i realized that i needed to go back to doing what i do best creating sugary masterpieces that no sane human being should be eating themselves at least since it's summertime and i love s'mores and i love cookies i decided to make a massive 5 000 plus calorie nutella s'mores cookie now since this is loaded with calories ladies and gentlemen it fit in perfectly with my diet for the day as did this digiorno pizza at this point stomach space is becoming incredibly limited which is why i had to go back to the shakes oh those delicious delicious shakes to maximize my calories i added in this toll brown bar and some olive oil and as to be expected some hershey syrup and just like that i had about a day and a half worth of calories and to finish things off i added in some cookies and some trail mix actually a lot of trail mix all right everybody so it is time for meal number four uh i'm not gonna lie right now it's uh this is where it really gets really gets difficult but here we are it's been a long time since i've done like a crazy calorie challenge like this so uh trying to do the best i can i just gotta say if you guys are enjoying the video it would mean the world to me if you guys smash that thumbs up button and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already because you guys get to see more craziness like this because if this video gets 50 000 likes i will do this every single day for an entire week just kidding yeah definitely kidding uh but you should like the video anyways anyways everybody what time is it goodness eight o'clock and it's time flies when you're having fun okay so it is 807 right now you guys can see the time right there so i've how many calories did i have that's 500 3 000 500 it seems like i forgot something miscalculated something in my calorie totals for the day so i do indeed have to finish this pack of oreos okay anyways folks we have a 5 000 calorie s'mores nutella cookie right there like that is well i've made a sizable dent in this nutella jar all right i also made two very high calorie shakes again i put some olive oil in here for easy calories along with some hershey syrup and then we have our plate of easy calories right here with some cookies oreos and a lot of trail mix and just like that folks i think we're ready to get meal number four officially started i'm gonna go ahead and put the total calories right up there for you guys in total macros will be right up there as well without further ado this is meal number four this is how i cut my carbs okay you guys i had you had to give me one joke in this video okay it's like the free pass can't guarantee there won't be more of those and here we go let's go [Music] so far so good now it's time for an addition now you guys are probably wondering what wow sauce is it's actually my own little secret creation all right been making up some new stuff in the kitchen lately one of those things has been some sauce here we are w oh [Music] this is probably one of the dumbest things i've ever tried to do in my life actually i feel like i say that on a weekly basis so never mind [Music] all right pizza is pretty much down i'm gonna move that over to the side i'm not gonna waste some space right now on the crust what is this salted caramel brownie oreos apparently they're topped with salt not bad [Music] first shake is down oh man guys [Music] now at the moment of truth let's see if this massive nutella s'more cookie is gonna be star of the show oh snap oh yes there we go nutella s'mores cookie that is nutella central right there wow i don't even know why i'm bothering cutting this but at this point i don't really even think it matters [Music] don't do that at home remember i'm a trained professional idiot and it's a common occurrence on this channel that i just eat marshmallows nothing nice [Music] oh [Music] oh i guess you're right oh man what we have a little bit of our s'more cookie nutella thing left to get to this trail mix get some easy calories in oh oh everyone i just get to the point where i don't even know what i'm thinking or doing anymore i'm just shoving food down my throat i never happen to you

how many hours do i have oh like one 10 hours left tonight's gonna be rough anyways let's put some wild sauce on this cookie right here i'm just kidding that's good but the wow sauce is more of a

that circulation going get that blood flowing that digestion moving oh yeah the digestion is really starting to hit me right now [Music] i guess it's time for a midnight snack after spending about half of an eternity in the bathroom don't worry i wash my hands it was time for some more high calorie shakes at this point the thought of consuming solid food was pretty much out of the question so i did what i could which in this case meant going back to the shakes oh those delicious delicious shakes and because the last thing i wanted to do was have this meal just be me drinking a ton of shakes i gravitated towards the most calorie dense foods i could possibly eat trail mix and cheesecake oh and doritos strictly for flavor fatigue purposes all right folks so here we are i've been up for almost 24 hours now i believe it or not i was up at about 4 a.m yesterday morning it was crazy just saying that but yeah anyways here we are almost 1am july 16th looks like we have basically six hours

should say you guys know oh man oh man it's like i got it more baby in there because i was in dire need of some beauty sleep and with how exhausted i was after this meal i decided to close my eyes and lay on the couch for an hour nap unfortunately that hour nap turned into a seven hour nap all right everybody well it's the next morning fortunately i slept through my alarm and it is now the 25th hour is now 8 47 which means unfortunately i wasn't able to get 50 000 calories down within 24 hours you suck honestly everybody i was beyond tired with my eyes closed last night so unfortunately

and I was scrolling through and I just felt like I went into a hole on a different part of Tik Tok that I haven't actually watched before what I eat as a fat girl or what I eat as a fat person I was going through all of the Tik toks and I was like you know what this would actually be a really good like video idea to just react to and give my like reaction and my opinions I say opinions just my reaction basically and what I think and see whether I relate to it as an exfat person myself I used to be moreid obes if you don't know who I am and this is the first video you're watching of mine yeah I was I was obese I was fat myself I used to weigh £269 and I started my weight loss journey and I lost £120 I share my journey here on YouTube so if you're interested in learning about weight

and you've done all three things and Bob's your uncle do you know what I mean let me know whether you eat like this whether you've eaten like it what your opinions are basically but remember to keep it kind in the comments this video is not to bash anyone I will be reacting to or to shame them or even tell them what they should eat cuz it's none of my business what they should eat but they've put what they eat on the internet and I'm just going to react to it in a nonjudgmental way if that makes sense like I'm not going to be mean to these people that's not my intention for this video to be mean or to PO little what they eat it's just as an exfat person myself just to kind of see and react to it basically it's just a bit of fun so let's just take that this video as like just a bit of entertainment a bit of fun and to just see how other people eat maybe why they might be overweight if that makes sense by what they eat so a little bit of Education in there H and maybe I could just suggest what you should eat if you are eating that and you want to lose weight or you want to make a healthier choice we can do that as well so that's what today's video is going to grab a coffee because I need a coffee and I've got it in my little cancer mug here cuz I'm a cancer so comment down below your star sign as well okay so first video What If fat girl eats in a day sh hash browns just hold on stop stop there you go sorry hash two hash browns and ketchup for breakfast that's not going to one fill me up if I just ate two hash browns for breakfast n you got to have some eggs with it you got to have some some bacon you got to have like some mushrooms some spinach so basically right what I'm going to do with this one is I'm going to say to actually have a POA breakfast there's nothing wrong with having hash browns I don't know if she put them in the air fryer or not in the beginning um but yeah you could air fry it maybe I I think Pete my personal trainer was saying he made his own hash browns you can actually make your own ones and in like the air fryer which I need to get an air fryer but yeah that's not going to fill anyone up like I wouldn't I don't think I even ever ate two hash brangs for breakfast like just on its own but I would say like just have like one hash brown have either like fried egg with like fright which is a one calorie spray and then you can have like turkey bacon and then fill up your plate with like lots of mushrooms lots of spinach bell peppers like slice them fry them up as well that's what I would normally have or like any veg or you can grill or tomato just make it like a lot more filling than two hash brown crisps potatoes so literally she's had two hash browns crisps and potato wedges I mean potato wedges with mayo I understand chips with mayo potato wedges with mayo if I was going to have like Mayo I would have um like ketchup and mayo or like sweet chili and Mayo like mix it but if you wanted to like make it healthier you can cut up your own potatoes and make your own chips and then the Mayo you can use that lighter than light mayo it's so much less calories and it tastes good anyway so yeah I would say that's what you could do or you can yeah with potatoes you basically cut them up spray it with like fry light salt pepper you can add some garlic powder paprika like season it how you want it and then what I do is I put them in the oven but obviously if you have a air fryer I feel like that would probably taste better and then yeah the extra like Mayo could do I guess she don't really care about you know she wants to be a fat girl I guess you know potatoes again she eating the potato I've never seen anyone eat like a jacket potato like a baked potato like that with cream cheese on it I've never I've never tried that but that's she's basically just eating potatoes the whole day so far with like a dollar of cream cheese and eating it like a that's so weird to eat like that do you guys eat a potato like I don't know I think that's a bit weird but there's nothing wrong with like a baked potato is that baked potato I SAR she was boiling a potato though Jack of potato is actually really good so when I have Jack of potato so I will I won't have like butter in it um or if I did have butter it would be the floral lightest butter that that's a lot lower calories because of the less fat in it I normally have like tuna with my lighter than like mayo and I mix that together I put that on top and then I will serve it with like a really big salad on the side and then I put Nando sauce on top or like the no added sugar beans and then eat lean cheese which is like a high protein low calorie cheese and I put that on top and then with a salad and then a bit of hot sauce yeah but that's how I have my potatoes and it's a lot more filling when you add the the salad on the side you're going to be full up I feel like she hasn't had any protein at all or veg okay yeah so she has got boiling potatoes she says a bit of butter and she chucks in the biggest amount of butter and may how I how do I make my potato before when I lost weight I did use to put so much butter in my pot mashed potato so like I would put butter in and then like I'd mash it and then I'd always add more butter and then I would like put butter on the top of it to melt cuz I just thought it tasted really nice but you're adding so many calories in by just doing that so if you wanted to make it like lower calorie which is how I would make my mashed potato now is I use like my unsweetened down with milk and if was going to add butter would be the lightest lightest Flora butter so it's like Flora lightest and I would literally add like just a teaspoon you don't really need that much and to be fair like I don't really feel like you taste much of a difference and then salt pepper and then season it like you know what I mean you can add a bit of garlic powder in there you can spice it up with a bit of paprika yeah it doesn't it doesn't need all the butter or even mayonnaise I mean I guess it probably tastes nicer but like you you don't have to add all that especially if you're trying to lose weight you don't need to be adding all of that creamy I don't know if it's the eggs or what but for dinner I had cheese and onion Mash guys oh my God this is such a banging dinner so easy and quick to make and literally stunning every time don't forget to put salt and pepper on it though just needs it if you have more time maybe like caramelize the onions and put them on top cuz that is stunning I can't have dinner without having dessert like literally more potato at least it's a different color I mean so far all I've seen is like beige like beige potatoes it's sweet potato what you putting on top hold on possible so I had one of my favorite desserts which is sweet potato and yogurt I've gone for vanilla you can go for strawberry sweet potato and yogurt that's so weird this is I would never this is this is weird I feel like why is she only eating potatoes such a good light dessert and it was late into the night and I'm not going to lie to you I was hungry again so I whacked these in the other little potato waffles and Ranch that's we today if you like this video follow me for more that girl so she basically just ate potatoes the whole day uh I mean if you're I know she's not technically trying to lose weight but if you're trying to lose weight yeah yeah definitely add some protein there some veg for some Fiber you don't need to have potatoes there's nothing wrong with eating potatoes or carbs but you you just not like only that you're not really getting much variety what I eat in a DAT as a fatty right let's watch this one hold on I love that double smoked ass so it weren't good okay cool that that did not look like coffee that looked like just milk what did she say oh that looks good I like Buffet too not going to lie I like I don't know am I allowed to put this video in she's saring we'll try we'll try yeah I like Buffet as well and sushi that look good I don't know what that fried thing was that she ate but that yeah that actually look good to be there is it she her face and she's eating the garlic red it's me I've never seen a seaweed salad like that normally like when I go to like a buffet I mean to be fair this is a sushi or you can eat sushi I've never been or you can eat sushi but like you know the crispy seaweed oh like when you get like Chinese oh banging I love that at least she's eating color you know I actually love her what mate I used to do that all the time like if I would go out and eat i' would still come home and like have snacks and like lay in bed or lay on the sofa and have like snacks so yeah I relate to that bit what is this what is that I thought they were like the mozzarella Dipper ones you know the one it's like cheese they look like chicken nuggets but cheese because they look so pale why do they look like pale I'm going to have your sauce yeah so if you wanted to you know cut your calories you need to watch out for the calories and the sauces I guarantee that sauce that she had it looked like a Cheesy kind of sauce is it I probably miss what she said but like they have so many calories that you add in okay so that was that one Munch Bunch oh my God I haven't had like a Munch Bunch yogurt in such a long time I normally have the protein yogurt so if you're going to have like a yogurt yeah if you want to know if you eat like this and you want to switch it up and lose weight instead of having a Munch Bunch you can get protein yogurts like protein mousse kind of things um kind of things kind of yogurts so it has like 20 grams of protein for about 160 calories which is really good and I get them from Littles but you can get like the Aro ones you can get them from anywhere like protein yogurt or even better fat-free Greek yogurt and then just add a bit of sweetener or like sweetened flavor drops to it add some fruit so it will like add fiber add more volume and you're going to be full up and like not as you won't be as full up on this as you would like that if that Mak sense and that's the secret to losing weight she don't care that she's fat she's just sharing what she eats so I'm not saying it to her but you know just for educational purposes oh I used to eat like that I used to eat the Kit Kats like that like eat the chocolate around the outside and then eat the inside I used to do that yeah that looks all right actually to be fair what about the portion size we have a look portion I really don't like beetroot though there that's just one food like that I can't I can't eat rro yeah that's good I feel like that's actually a really good thing like when you cuz that was a problem when I was bigger is that when I would eat even if I was full up I would I wouldn't leave leftovers I would always force myself to eat it so I think that's actually a good thing that she did like she realized she was full and she stopped eating but I feel like she's about to eat some noodles now and these aren't the best for you anyway are they I feel like these kind of noodles are great gross as well I don't like like pot noodle I used to like Bombay Bad Boy Pot noodle but yeah like noodles and stuff like that now like yeah the T I can't eat it now okay cool cool cool yogurt banana and peanut butn what was that Miss noodle with mac and cheese noodles and mac and cheese together that's weird that's weird I'm sorry that is that's a bit weird lowkey judging vegie St Reggie STS with hummus that's good what are these what are these veggies Jaws I mean you could have like carrot sticks and hummus uh peppers and hummus I like to have or cucumber and Hummers Pizza [Music] pizza for supper I mean to be fair her diet isn't too bad to be fair like she is eating quite a bit of fruit I mean like the pizza you could just make your pizza yourself if you want to lose weight obviously I'm say she does but I feel like is a lot better than the potatoes all day okay okay so this girl's trying to lose weight she wants to enjoy weight loss so let me drink my coffee first so she actually wants toose weight so let's see breakfast fake B bacon buty with Tommy K okay fake bacon buty it looked like she didn't really have anything else in there I mean I I think if you wanted to make it like more fill in to lose weight what I would do cuz I always like think if I was going to have like a bacon sandwich I have to like make it fill in so I would add like mushrooms in there or spinach egg whites like you can soak the the bread in egg whites and fry it so then you're getting like loads of protein and then I'd use turkey bacon I don't know what fake bacon is but yeah Cherry Jammy Dodgers mate I have not seen them ones I've not seen them ones but they're like I think they're like nearly 90 calories of biscuit though that's literally like me if I find something I like and like a food or something I like I will eat it all the time until I do eventually get sick of it so yeah that is it like me but okay so what she had so far so she this is she said she wants to enjoy weight loss I'm confused she had a bacon sandwich Jammy judgers pot noodle okay well if she wants to lose weight um I don't think that that her what she's eating there in the nicest way possible is going to help her cuz pot noodles are so many calories as well and they're really not fill in I mean you could have definitely like if you wanted to have a pot noodle I would say add veg to it and like protein but like yeah pot noodle isn't the best food to be eaten when you want to lose weight just because it's not filling Jammy there's nothing wrong with her having a couple of Jammy Dodgers obviously I don't know if she's tracking her calories but yeah having like one or two Jammy Dodgers with a tea you can have that and lose weight at the same time and then the dinner ordering a pasta that would have been so many calories especially if you ordered it as well but yeah she doesn't say whether she went out for walk or anything like that to increase your the amount of calories you're burn in yeah I didn't really see a lot of like veg or any veg unless there was some in the pasta and like protein so okay let's watch this one hold on if you don't don't dip your sandwich in the soup you don't need I mean she she don't really I know she don't care right but you don't need to have a sandwich and noodles at the same time and then dip it I know I'm weird and I dip things in things like chocolate and coffee but that actually tastes nice this is is a bit weird but I guess you I've never tried it so well I've not I'm noticing a trend on these Tik Tok videos that like people love to eat noodles yeah I see people noodles in it I don't know what that was that she was dipping in there but that looked weird oh I see chocolate spread on toast I used to eat chocolate spread on toast so we're going to watch this one hold on what eating a day as a fat girl 8 a.m. toast a Nutella and a Pepsi Max I love my Pepsi Max but 8 in the morning to have a Pepsi Max have a coffee man have a coffee of that chocolate spread on toast 12:30 p.m. spaghetti Hoops cheese string chocolate Nest Nest cek slice and a Coke Zero you're just eating a bowl of spaghetti hoops and a cheese drink cheese strings are gross man I hate cheese strings I think they're so gross spaghetti hoops and a n that's that Nest quick slice is like a yogurt um it's like it's almost like a cake but it's like with yogurt inside it's like a yogurt kind of slice they're all right to be fair like they're not like that bad like my kids have that with their pack lunch but like spaghetti Hoops for lunch that's weird that's weird you know spaghetti Hoops yeah whenever I used to have them when I was a kid who else does this yet I used to put get my fork and then like hook the spaghetti Hoops on and like you know how like Fork has like four things you know spikes on the fork you know what I mean I would I would literally go and like put all of the spaghetti Hoops on each of them and E like that cuz I'm a weird eye let me know if you did that okay Le to be fair Le she's having like no calories on her drinks she's she's doing the right thing with like Pepsi Max Coke Zero what is this refrigerators I do love refrigerators refrigerators are a really good protein snack to be fair and then cookie dough and Nutella Burger chips ketchup that's kind of food I used to eat back in the day to be fair when I was bigger I did used to do that yeah apple juice oh apple juice is really not good for you there's so many calories so much sugar and apple juice just have water and an apple do you know what I mean like yeah don't don't be drinking they're not it's not good for you so many people think like drinking apple juice or orange juice is a healthy option it's really not P gr 11 o00 ordered uh McDonald's okay well that's interesting to be fair what does she get from McDonald's she got burger and chicken nuggets that's think I would have done I would have done that my order from McDonald's when I was bigger was I would get a large Big Mac meal and then I would always get like a burger on the side and I would get a McFlurry so I'd get like either like a cheeseburger double cheeseburger or like a Mayo Chicken on the side I wouldn't get full up on McDonald's cuz McDonald's is really not fill in it's like fake food like you never actually get like full up yeah because there's not a lot of fiber but I feel like just from watching this you can see a trend of it's mostly like carbs and fats and not a lot of protein or veg so if you wanted to like if you eat a little bit like that just to make it healthier and to maybe make a little bit of a change to lose weight like what I would have done or what I've done is I would add like make sure there's protein in there and lots and lots of Edge and like just cook it in a different way so by using like fright or whatever instead air fry in your food or you swapping out the sources like going for the lower calorie sources and the lower calorie like yeah making lower calorie swaps if that makes sense that's way you can kind of switch it up to make it healthier and to fit in with your weight loss goals while still eating it if that makes sense let me know whether you want me to react to more Tik Tok videos what kind of Tik toks you want me to react to cuz this was pretty fun pretty interesting to see thank you so much for watching I will see you guys in the next one bye [Music] oh""",1
"Jasper wildfire has caused '30 to 50 per cent structural damage,' says Alberta premier
",0
"""Sarah galashan was listening to that news conference a lot to cover uh Sarah but that what we heard there from uh the premier 30 to 50% structural damage again this is preliminary but we also have been able to verif verify some video and we do see significant structural damage and and buildings burned to the ground yeah Andrew I mean it does speak to the video that we're seeing it's a the video is showing a small section but it's really complete loss in those videos that we have seen and the idea that uh potentially at least because at this point the fire is still it is still burning out of control around Jasper um but at least half possibly of Jasper lost to this Wildfire you could it was an extraordinary show of emotion coming from Premier Danielle Smith that she was fighting back those tears and really you know sharing in the grief that we know is being felt by all those thousands of residents uh and tourists but primarily those those residents who were forced to evacuate on Monday uh some of them still in town throughout British Columbia some of them making their way back to evacuation centers in in Alberta um but we have heard in the leadup to this uh calls for them to seek uh support and that supports are available and you could see that there even the the premier there in an emotional state as she described that law as a place that is so special to the residents but also to thousands if hundreds of thousands of people around the world for whom Jasper is a bucket list trip a place so beautiful that they have or still want uh to visit uh because of the the spectacular Beauty around uh that area in that mountain town um in terms of the firefight it is as I say still ongoing uh there is rain in the northern half of the province we heard but also Gusty winds and you talked about the devastating effect that the wind had last night on that fire forcing uh those Flames forcing uh emergency Personnel Wildland firefighters to have to evacuate because as structures um became uh engulfed in flames it's a totally different kind of firefight we heard it releases toxins into the air and so only what we call structural firefighters were able to stay behind and and fight off what they could uh and heroes certainly they are uh but obviously not all structures could be saved and and that's what we've heard you also heard in that press conference I think we could call it some subtle frustration at the the the place at the table or lack thereof that the province has had in terms of making decisions when comes to this firefight what it is right now is because it's in h Parks Canada territory here that it's a unified command between the town of Jasper and Parks Canada and of course relying on resources coming from Alberta wildfire and we heard about those resources that were deployed they unfortunately couldn't use the night vision aircraft because of all the smoke in the area but it was all on hand for them that Alberta uh clearly very much wants to have a seat at the table in terms of making these decisions uh we know that uh Federal ministers are are are on root going to be having discussions uh with the provincial government I heard her say as well she'll be speaking with the prime minister at 2:30 PM mountain time and she reiterated the fact several times Daniel Smith did that they will be uh asking for calling for a more unified command involving the province so that uh all resources and the decisions around utilizing them and and deploying them can be made very quickly it wasn't not positive toward the the calls that they have had with hargie Sedin uh but they they want uh to be part of that unified command it's a sort of a unique situation given that we're we're talking about Parks Canada here uh but as you said we'll be hearing from Parks Canada uh in terms of I suppose what's to come what has happened here and perhaps more of an update as to exactly what has been lost in Jasper but the pictures we already knew were devastating that we have seen and now to hear such a high percentage of the Town may be lost that is going to be hitting people certainly throughout Alberta and in many communities in British Columbia where those evacuees still are are going to be thinking very hard yeah I I mean there's so so many questions about how this happened and some jurisdictional questions of course people are dealing with just the loss of these structures we did hear an official say it is true that uh provincial night vision helicopters were made available to the town to Parks Canada last night but because of the conditions it was just too dangerous to use them so that is what an Alberta official had to say uh about that but so many more questions and so many more answers that we uh hope to hear from officials at all levels about how this happened and and how this this this fight is going as it continues for now though Sarah thank you the CBC Sarah galashan""

"""this was me at my heaviest I wasn't ever truly happy with the way I looked but one day I didn't recognize my body my usual sizes didn't fit me anymore so I got more and more frustrated at myself for letting it get to this point fast forward and this is me today 10 kilos lighter and I'm feeling the strongest and healthiest I've ever felt in my life I think it's so important to look at why most diets fail rather than jumping straight into what exercises to do or meal planning for the week your experience may be different from mine but I always failed my diets when I gave in to quote-unquote bad food like sugary snacks bubble tea chips anything when you indulge on bad food usually it feels pretty good at first but then it follows with this chain of emotions that you usually bring upon yourself like self-pity guilt disappointment and even self-forgiveness when you start a diet usually either consciously or subconsciously you have an idea of what foods you should be saying no to and usually those are the foods that you really enjoy so at diet for me was always a constant test of my willpower to not eat those delicious food but the longer I go without the food that makes me happy the less happy I'll feel for one maybe one day I will crave it a lot and then give in therefore failing my diet you get the wave of emotions the cycle repeats but then your patient starts to run thin for yourself so how do we stop food from calling our name on our weakest day since when did food become a hundred percent no bad food and 100 food straight from the ground how do we not get tempted by all the food around us now that I'm on the other side I recognize how those internal conversations kept me and potentially many others in a very vicious Loop so in today's video I'm going to be sharing my five tips to ease yourself into your weight loss journey and Lead this healthy and balanced lifestyle that everybody talks about one of the biggest challenges that I didn't know I needed to face at the start of this weight loss journey is actually emotional eating I tend to turn a food when I'm feeling stressed accomplished in need of comfort or even when I'm bored and while there's nothing inherently wrong with enjoying food it can become a problem when it becomes a coping mechanism breaking out of this has been difficult and it's taken a lot of mental fortitude to overcome my dependence on food to feel good I thought that if I could stop the cycle of cravings and just break that entirely then maybe I can actually be successful at my diet for once and that's when I discovered this book by Janine Roth Breaking Free from emotional eating contains practical tips and strategies for overcoming emotional eating and I love that the tips are all taught through the experiences and reflections of people who are also going through the same struggles one of the most important things I've learned is to stop using food as a reward instead of celebrating a productive day at work with a massive meal or a sugary snack I try to find other ways of rewarding myself like through giving myself the free time to do anything that I wanted even if it's Doom scrolling even if it's reading a book as long as it's not food related something else I've realized is that if I stop putting my favorite foods on a pedestal I actually usually end up thinking about it less and therefore craving it less don't think about elephants what are you thinking about another strategy has been to practice mindfulness and self-awareness when it comes to my eating habits and my emotions when I turn to food for Comfort I just like to take a moment and pause to check in with myself am I really hungry or am I feeling stressed if it's the latter then I try to find other ways to cope like journaling maybe that will help or even talking to my partner about how I'm feeling this book really pulled me out of this tunnel vision with food and I started to realize just really how manipulative it can be it's time to get started without those Cravings holding you back links down below you won't regret it if you want to learn more about how your body stores fat and other tips for accelerating your weight loss goals then keep on watching when dieting I always focus on cutting calories and increasing my cardio but I realize that there's another really important factor to consider and that is insulin insulin is a hormone that helps our bodies to store energy from the food that we eat when we eat our bodies release insulin to help move that energy into our cells but if our body these are constantly bombarded with food our insulin levels can remain elevated which can make it harder for us to burn fat or enter fat burning Zone insulin also spikes depending on what types of foods you eat so instead of opting for a carb heavy meal that can spike your insulin and then cause a sugar crash or a food coma try and find nutrient dense foods that will keep your insulin low and steady to be honest I was never really one for diets and the word diet can mean so many things nowadays if you look it up on Google you'll find two meetings one refers to the types of foods and drinks that a person consumes regularly and the other refers to a temporary reduction of food and drink usually for the purpose of losing weight the idea of restricting myself and calorie counting just seems so exhausting for one and unsustainable I just wanted to eat whatever I wanted and still be skinny and that leads us to our next tip which is intermittent fasting I think some people might view intermittent fasting as some sort of diet that's on the same playing field as these days diet but it's more of a long-term diet that doesn't actually limit the amount of food or the types of foods that you can have instead it's just a little bit more restrictive in terms of when you can eat so if I can still have ice cream bubble tea and all those great things but I just need to have them within a certain time of the day then that's a pretty good trade anyway so I gave it a go and I set my eating window between 12 P.M to 8 PM every day the idea is to limit the amount of time that your body is producing insulin and to be honest at first I was skeptical after understanding a little bit more about insulin it sort of makes sense to keep it around only for a portion of the day rather than sporadically throughout the day by sticking to my eating window and allowing myself to eat whatever I wanted within that time frame I found that I was able to satisfy my Cravings in moderation without feeling deprived and because I was only eating during a limited window of time I found that I wasn't constantly thinking about food intermittent fasting has truly been a game changer for me you can eat the same thing but if you just timed it differently it could be the difference between you continuing to put on weight or losing weight I would recommend starting off this journey with more of a stronger focus on the nutritional value of food rather than the numerical value of food like three calories you want to set yourself up for success and while calorie counting is a very easy and common way of tracking the amount of food that you've had I feel like it's quite easy to lose sight of what is actually good for your body not all calories are made equal so it can be misleading if you just relied on the number to determine what you can and can't eat especially when we're busy and on the go I feel like it's quite easy to lose sight and Pick convenience over health I still remember when I used to choose fast food for most meals and I would still feel very good about it it was a cheaper faster more convenient option and it still fit within my calorie limit so I convinced myself I was going to be losing weight even though I was eating KFC every day but then I would experience all sorts of fatigue because the food I was eating wasn't nourishing my body and that's why I would recommend starting off your journey with more of a focus on nutrition rather than calorie counting it's more aligned with your long-term health goals anyway and it's good to get some practice in for making those decisions so that would look like paying more attention to things like fiber Protein healthy fats and generally making sure that you're getting a good balance of everything is much more sustainable and important for your long-term Health the great thing about this method is that it allows for so much flexibility and Variety in your diet you can still have fast food just have it in moderation but more importantly focus on things that will make you feel your best of course this doesn't mean that calorie counting is not useful or that it doesn't work it definitely works I just don't think it's very suitable as a daily measure to maintain your health over the long term even for me like calorie counting put me into a scarcity mindset and I started to make very poor decisions with my food that I'd urge you to focus on what you're fueling your body with rather than calorie counting one thing that has been key to my weight loss journey is the art of showing up and the power of a routine when we make healthy habits part of our routine it's more likely to stick with us over the long term of course building a routine isn't easy it takes time and effort to build new habits and sometimes we're going to fall back onto our old patterns and that's why I've found this book Atomic Habits by James clear to be incredibly helpful clear's approach to Habit formation emphasizes the importance of small incremental changes that will add up over time on days where going to the gym seems extremely far-fetched just by simply putting on my leggings changes that from uh I don't really feel like it today to I need to move my body there's just something about outfits and how they can just really put you into another headspace and then my next goal is to Simply Rock up to the gym just get there that's my next goal the point is to not look too far ahead just focus on what next that will help you towards getting to where you need to be because when I look back just a small habit like wearing leggings it's the difference between going and not going to the gym which is huge can you imagine the amount of progress you'll make to anything that you do if you just mastered the art of showing up and the power of a routine and of course there are still days where I slip up or fall off track whether it's starting my day with oxyshred or putting on my leggings maybe even preparing my leggings the night before or prioritizing sleep these habits have become an integral part of my daily routine and setting myself up for making better decisions I hope that these tips are helpful for you and that you feel inspired and motivated for your weight loss Journey it will take some time but if you implement each of these steps and get good at them you're moving forward with the best mindset possible and the best environment for you to thrive without your Cravings holding you back I'd also really love to know your thoughts on my tips did you learn anything new are you already implementing any of these I'd love to know down in the comment box below I will be checking them out and thank you so much for watching I will see you in my next one if you enjoyed today's

"Clean Eating For Beginners | Never ""diet"" again

"""clean eating does not have to be complicated and today i want to show you what an easy day of eating clean and healthy can look like simple whole food recipes with everyday ingredients that you can find at any grocery store and less than one hour of standing in the kitchen exactly like my six week clean eating mastery program but more about that at the end of the video the simplest way to make a wholesome healthy breakfast is to take one minute the night before to prepare it yes one minute that's what it takes to make overnight oats and it's super super simple absolutely delicious the next day and it's just a grab and go breakfast so let me show you how to make it all you have to do is add three quarters of a cup of old-fashioned rolled oats to a sealable container also add three quarters of a cup of your favorite milk any milk works plant milk cow's milk whatever you love and then place it in the fridge overnight and the next morning you can top it with some berries and drizzle a little maple syrup over it and enjoy it now if you work outside the home you might want to prepare your lunch the night before as well but even if you work from home it's always a good idea to have lunch ready in the fridge because that way we just grab it and eat it and we make sure we eat clean and healthy and don't grab any unhealthy snacks because we're ravenous and we really don't want to prepare anything for us so let's prepare lunch for tomorrow shall we pull out your instant pot to cook some quinoa or check out my guide on how to cook quinoa on the stove add one cup of quinoa and one cup of water to the instant pot because that's the minimum necessary to get it to pressure and then place a trivet into the pot as well and add two large fridge cold eggs to it we will only need one egg for the lunch bowl but since i'm cooking double the amount of quinoa i might as well add another egg and have everything ready for a second lunch bowl for another day i love that i can cook quinoa and hard-boiled eggs at the same time in the instant pot and it only takes one minute on high pressure plus full natural pressure release now let's prep the veggies get a lebanese cucumber a carrot a handful of grape or cherry tomatoes and a small handful of parsley then peel the carrot and then julienne or grate it cut off the ends of your lebanese cucumber and cut it into slices and lastly finely chop your parsley and set all of this aside now it's time to prepare your dressing but be vigilant of your instant pot so you don't miss the moment natural pressure release is over or else your eggs will overcook you want to make sure that as soon as the safety pin drops you want to take out those eggs and put them in the ice bath to stop from cooking for the dressing you want to add the juice of half a lemon one tablespoon olive oil and sea salt and pepper to taste to a sealable jar and then shake it until well combined by now your quinoa and eggs are probably ready remove the eggs immediately as i said after the safety pin dropped and add them to the ice bath to stop the eggs from cooking further and now it's already time to assemble your quinoa lunch bowl add half of the quinoa you cooked into a sealable container then top it with your julienned carrot your sliced cucumber your grape tomatoes and lastly your hard-boiled egg then seal it and oh wait wait wait wait i forgot the chopped parsley it's not complete without the parsley now seal it and place it in the fridge together with a dressing pour that over your lunch bowl only seconds before you're ready to dive in or else your cucumber and veggies will become all soggy so do that the second you're ready to eat your lunch now for dinner let's keep it simple but still super super delicious get two skinless boneless chicken thighs and season the heck out of them here i have half a teaspoon paprika half a teaspoon oregano a quarter teaspoon chili powder half a teaspoon sea salt and a little bit of black pepper add the spices to both the sides of your chicken thighs and then set them aside now get a small sweet potato and peel it and then cut it into about half inch slices make sure they are not much thicker than that or they won't cook through now preheat a large pan over medium heat and once it's really hot add a splash of avocado oil to it and place both your chicken thighs and sweet potato slices into the sizzling oil and brown for five minutes on one side and five minutes on the other before you add a splash of water to the pan to the glaze the bottom and also add a handful of green asparagus and cover the pan with a lid reduce the heat to low and let this all steam for approximately 20 minutes or until the sweet potato is tender when you plate your chicken sweet potato slices and steamed asparagus don't forget to pour the delicious pan juices over everything it's the best part and there you have it a full day of eating clean breakfast took one minute to prepare lunch 15 to 20 minutes and dinner 40 minutes but of those 40 minutes you didn't have to do anything for 20 because everything was steaming right so if this day looks and sounds delicious to you and you want to make clean eating part of your lifestyle the best way to change your eating habits is to commit to that change for at least six weeks that way you internalize it that way it becomes a routine and somewhat of an automatic daily decision after six weeks of eating clean and healthy you will feel amazing and you can't even imagine eating junk food and processed food on the regular ever again if you are finally committed to turn your life around you can start today by joining the six week clean eating mastery program and i have all the information you need for that in the description and that is it for today i hope you enjoyed the video and maybe i'll see you in the six week program that would be so amazing i hope you have a wonderful day bye""

"Week of Nourishing Breakfasts

"""[Music] I am so excited to be back in my kitchen today I filming and sharing a week of nourishing breakfast SL brunch ideas today is Monday so I'm about to whip up breakfast sometimes it's grab and go today I'm just in the mood for something extra extra yummy so you'll see hopefully it will just encourage you to step into your kitchen even if it's like I always say just to create one thing this week makes a world of difference for more of my recipes more ideas more inspiration you can head over to my website at ww. Tish wonders. co.uk go and check out all of my recipe ebooks over there so let's put Monday's breakfast SL brunch together let's cook it let's do it let's go I'm really in the mood for Turkish eggs but I don't want to poach my eggs so I'm going to do it all in one pan and I'm going to add some I've got some jar roasted red peppers I'm going to add some of that in um but I'm just you know when you're just craving something like I want eggs I want yogurt I want the spiced butter M yum I'm going to start off by doing the yogurt first because the eggs will cook in minutes so it's good to have the yogurt ready before so I've got some Greek yogurt I've got some dill a lemon garlic so grab a bowl and place in the Greek yogurt um and squeeze in some lemon juice I like to throw a touch of garlic some people like to throw cloves of garlic in I'm like no no no let me just add a little bit of garlic ideally it will be finally finally grated just make sure it is not chunky completely completely optional you can chop up and you can throw in some fresh dill place a little bit of salt in you could use parsley if you prefer that whatever herbs you like go with whatever you like the taste of whatever you have as well just like I mentioned with the yogurt we're actually going to prepare the butter in advance as well so once the eggs are cooked we can just throw this together so grab a pan heat it on a medium heat place your knob of butter in so let everything melt down and place in your alipo pepper plus your chili flakes so give your pan a really good Shake making sure that the butter is fully infused and just place your pan to the side so there's not much to do with these roasted red peppers we're just going to open up our jar drain a few Peppers off and simply chop them up if you don't want to do the step and you actually just prefer like a classic Turkish egg dish then you can just poach your eggs but like I mentioned I don't want poached eggs today I want eggs cooked as you're about to see on a low to medium heat place a little olive oil into a pan and place in those Jarred chopped red peppers cook for a minute or so and then crack in your eggs season with some salt and some pepper and then cover your pan reduce the Heat and cook your eggs for about 5 to 7 minutes just keep an eye on it I definitely for this recipe want a runny yolk I grabbed my little bowl I placed in that garlicky Dill infused yogurt topping it with those gorgeous eggs not leaving even a speck of that [Music] butter those eggs oh my my God that's how that's how I like an egg oh my God makes me so happy wow I need another piece of toast that's how you start Monday it's going to be a good week so it's really early I'm definitely that person that like wakes up with an appetite like I love obviously clearly love breakfast I don't train before 7:30 I have to eat something before I train and I haven't trained yet so I'm going to head to the gym but before that I'm going to make a little porridge very very simple sometimes when I'm lying in bed I think M what am I going to have for breakfast like those thoughts come into my head um so last night I was like let me put some oats to soak and I also added in some of this musle which is just a standard basic mus I sometimes like adding some musi in just because of the dried fruit that's added and there's like sunflower seeds in here Brazil nuts I just put everything to soak in a sauce pan can doesn't look great now but I'm actually going to just drain the water off and then just add some almond milk and it's going to cook really really quick everything's kind of softened anyways and I'm going to add my toppings on top very very simple breakfast this morning I really go through phases of loving oats and I'm definitely in an oat phase right now I'm going to add some Greek yogurt on top I've got some berries and I've also got some seeds so every now and then I know I've spoken about it before I'll really get into seed cycling and this month I've just been on it so I've got a blend of pumpkin seeds and what else flax seeds that I whizzed up in my blender earlier on this week I don't feel like I've ever properly committed myself to seed cycling over like a long period of time but I always have intentions to so maybe it's going to be a thing from now on the first half of my cycle um I will sprinkle on top pumpkin and flax seeds and then for the second half of my cycle um which is like the beginning of the Lal phase um up until my period actually comes I will do sesame seeds and sunflower seeds apparently there's a science behind it I don't know maybe you guys have had some experience with seed cycling but what I do know is that there is absolutely no harm in adding extra pumpkin seeds flax seeds sunflower seeds and sesame seeds um to whatever I'm eating throughout the month so let me put this porridge together cuz I've got a class that I need to get to [Music] some almond milk obviously you can spice the porridge up however you want you can add nutmeg you can add cinnamon uh this cinnamon by the way this Vietnamese cinnamon is so strong it's really potent I'm not complaining it's delicious but my goodness you only need a little touch of this stuff definitely got into the habit of adding in a protein powder when I'm eating oats and actually you know what I can feel the difference I'm not well versed when it comes to protein powders I'm not the most scored on that topic but when I do use a protein powder if I use a protein powder it has always been this form one this has been a long-standing favorite of mine which I have repeatedly bought form recently sent me an extra packet cuz they saw how much I liked it this one's in finished so it's just come in good time um but yeah I'll usually add like a little bit of protein powder into my oats as well and then I'll have the Greek yogurt which has also got extra protein I love the unsweetened ones just because I'm a bit sensitive to overly sweet things but they also sent me some of their other flavors to try which I will give a go maybe in smoothies um but for now yeah this unflavored one does it for me I have the tiniest drop of coconut milk I love coconut milk just adding a little bit at the end just cuz it makes it super creamy um sometimes I'll add 100% coconut milk but today it's a mix of almond and coconut favorite part of my morning when I'm having porridge is choosing the toppings obviously this honey that I picked up recently is so delicious it's from a shop in Hackney called food for all on K and off road if anyone is wondering I'm also still in my hemp seed phase so hemp seeds are just a must and then along with that I've got some bee pollen from raw pop which is just the best the best of the best I've also got a variety of berries so strawberries blueberries and some raspberries I placed on top some Greek yogurt all of those berries a little touch of that honey some hemp seeds plus that blend of pumpkin and flax seeds which I spoke about earlier finishing with some bee pollen there is no holding back when it comes to the toppings it's my favorite part yum I'm thinking what am I going to cook up for my breakfast SL brunch today I did some hot yoga this morning which always takes it out of me but it makes me feel really good at the same time and I did some weights um but after I eat I know I'll be feeling more energized I was in St Lucia a few weeks ago and my dad randomly made this it was so good it was like this tuna fish fata which if you're not a tuna person you'll probably be like no way I'm just going to try off the top of my head do what I think think he did but I have no idea if it's going to work out or turn out the same way because that was a good fata but it's basically just tuna onions I think he threw garlic in there which I'm probably not going to do but I'm just going to do tuna onions and um eggs I was also thinking cherry tomatoes would work really well cooked within the fata type thing that I'm about to cook but I think I'm in a uncooked keep it fresh cherry tomato type of mood but we'll see let's go with the flow let's see let's see how it turns out let's do this so grabbing a red onion if you don't have a red onion of course a white onion is going to work just fine even if you want to use spring onions that will be perfect too so I'm going to use a little bit of olive oil I actually might throw a little bit of butter in there as well just a combination of [Music] both I'm using a little bit of ground black pepper place a little salt so I'm going to add a little bit of oregano in there as well so this is my dandelion and Tulsi Tea it's probably been sit oh God teapot is not that great is it so whilst those onions are cooking down nice and slow I'm just going to crack my eggs into a bowl give them a bit of salt and then throw this thing together and it'll be done in no time I don't think I'm going to put those tomatoes in I think I'm going to put the tomatoes on top so I cracked my eggs into a bowl use as many eggs as you desire I used three eggs for this and then I opened my tin of tuna so once your onions have cooked down and they have softened you can place in that chuna got a little bit of green seasoning that I'm going to add in if you want to add any kind of hot sauce chili sauce that you like you can do that I'm just going to add a touch a green seasoning so combine the tuna and the onions before placing in those whisked eggs so I'm going to put it in the oven at about 10 oh my God let me turn this off actually it's a bit too low about 180° I'm going to leave in there for about 10 minutes 10 minutes maybe 12 minutes we'll see I'll keep an eye on [Music] it have some fresh tomatoes and I've also got some uh I've got some rocket I think in the fridge as well but this is going to be delicious this looks completely different to the one that my dad made so I actually need to get a full breakdown of that recipe properly I think but um I know this is going to be delicious either way you know what I put salmon in a fata but I had never put tuna and it's just this is one that you're going to make again and again once you try it I only plated three pieces but I'm going to grab that last one more fresh tomatoes and like you know when you're eating a meal Midway through and you're like you just top up your plate let me put a banic as well ooh yes please thank you I had a breakfast this morning I just wasn't able to film it cuz I was in such a hurry to rush out the door it was really early but I had a really filling smoothie so I'm not so hungry I an oat and raspberry smoothie I used that same protein powder it was really delicious it was also very very filling as well so I'm not the hungriest but I do feel like lots and lots of steamed greens this morning so I'm going to steam some broccoli if I want a really nourishing breakfast something that's going to make me feel good that's super simple this is the perfect example lots of steamed greens with salt and a good olive oil oil A protein that feels good for me which is usually eggs and um maybe a few other things on the side I've got an avocado so I'm definitely going to add some avocado onto my plate and I've got these like piadas these little flatbreads which are delicious I'll probably warm some of those up just said that smoothie was filling now I'm talking about like a whole five course breakfast but if you know me you know I can eat I also wanted to share with you what I've been using over the past few months these are element electrolytes I had about five boxes of these and I'm down to this is the box which is just filled with all the random flavors so if you're someone who feels really low energy after you train obviously that could be for so many reasons but it would be worth just seeing if it's the case of you're not replenishing um the electrolytes that are lost just through sweating these are my favorite so every time I go to the gym and I know I'm going to sweat a lot I do um a whole one liter flask of water and I just add a whole sachche in and just sip sip on it it's the best so yeah anyways let's put together today's official breakfast a little stacking of the dishwasher a little tidying up before I get going tidying up this morning smoothie making mess I fancied a little peppermint tea you know herbal tea bags are never strong enough so of course I doubled up and I grabbed those steaming trays said it before I'll say it again steaming trays are probably my most loved possession in my kitchen they get the most use I love them couldn't be without them so yeah put my broccoli to steam and I chopped up some cherry tomatoes I combine them with some Basel some olive oil some oregano and a little bit of salt you know what I cook that plant in I cook half the plant and I've had it all so I'm going to fry the other half I still like my broccoli with a little bit of a bite you know I don't want it overly overly cooked I want it cooked but not overly cooked placed on some salt and this gorgeous olive oil that I'm using today very generous amount so whilst My Pan was Heating to cook my scrambled eggs up I just chopped up some avocado the last thing to do was to cook these scrambled eggs so what I do is I heat my pan on like medium heat and then once I put the eggs in I turn the heat off completely the eggs are still going to cook but they're just not going to dry out they're not going to go dry just stirred for maybe like 30 seconds or so until I reach my desired type of scrumbled eggs obviously if you want to cook them for a bit longer you can and then just serve them serve them up [Music] so just so you know these are the pienas that I used you can find these I think you can find the big ones in s bre but the mini ones you need to check weit tros out I think they're the only Supermarket I've ever seen the mini ones so they are really really delicious you know what there's just something about having cooked vegetables in the morning cooked greens specifically tell me that adding a bowl of steamed greens to your life for 7 Days won't change how you feel the combo never gets old eggs planting avocado I chopped up some cherry tomatoes with some torn Basel add a little bit of dried oregano olive oil and a little pea perfect so it's a Friday and I want a super Speedy easy quick tasty brunch um so I'm going to put together just butter beans with Chay tomatoes and garlic sounds basic simple and it is basic and simple but sometimes basic and simple works well if you have a good tasting Bean makes all the difference I've got a bit of bread I tried out this sourdough a couple of weeks ago it's um let me show you it's called Jason's sourdough so this is the seeded one they also have a white sourdough but I haven't tried out that one but it's really tasty just remembered I've also got like ah my favorite got some cottage cheese I'll just spread that on the toast and then I will put those cherry tomato butter beans garlicky cherry tomato butter beans over it so starting off we will just have our cherry tomatoes you can use any type of tomatoes that you have by the way and also if you're using cherry tomatoes and you'd rather just keep keep them whole and throw them in the pan as they are that's also fine so I grabbed my pan just heating it on a low to medium heat and whilst that was heating up I just finally chopped up my garlic so adding a little bit of olive oil into the pan I threw in all of that chopped garlic on a very very low heat really important that you don't burn your garlic you just really want to cook it gently for a few minutes shortly after you can place in your chopped cherry tomato just giving everything a good stir seasoned with some salt and some pepper if you want to like I did you can add in a little bit of dried oregano and just continue stirring continue moving everything in the pan as those cherry tomatoes break down and just become infused in that garlicky olive oil just gets so delicious um you can go ahead and open up either your jar of butter beans or your carton or your tin of butter beans so yeah I just gave my butter beans a good rinse before throwing them in the pan along with those cherry tomatoes so combining those butter beans and those cherry tomatoes you can place in a little bit more black pepper if you want to and just let those butter beans and cherry tomatoes just do their thing on a low heat just let them cook for around 5 minutes for a little extra touch I'm going to stir a little bit of red pesto in that I had in my fridge which actually need's using so ratio of cherry tomatoes and butter beans was a little bit on equal usually I prefer a few more cherry tomatoes in something like this um so that's why I looked in the fridge and I found red pesto and just thought yeah this will be the perfect addition so yeah just last little bit I just needed to toast up my toast and um put those butter beans on the toast so this is the riverford cottage cheese and for me it's probably the best tasting cottage cheese that's out there if you're in the UK excited finished with a little bit the basil simple but effective and delicious let's have a taste you've been seeing my concentration food face my food concentration of face all week M that's Andre to no it's actually red pepper pesto but that red pesto definitely works oh my God this is so damn good let me know in the comments which one you'll be making you might be making two you might make three you might make all of them let me know really hope these ideas have just given you that little push that we all need sometimes it's fine um just to step into your kitchen get to cooking create a beautiful meal for yourself because you deserve it I will see you all in my next video very very soon I'm going to go sit down and enjoy this I want to sit down in peace and enjoy this meal see you all soon [Music]""

"Octopus vs Underwater Maze
",0
"""This is my pet octopus named Sashimi. And this is a vault\nfilled with all her favorite food. The only problem is,\nin order to get to this vault, she'll have to rely on her incredible\nintelligence and dexterity to make it all the way through this\nnine part underwater obstacle course. And just like when I made my backyard\nobstacle course for squirrels, out of the gate,\nI will admit in hindsight, I completely underestimated the\ncapabilities of this remarkable creature. But to understand how we even ended up\nat this spot, we need to go back in time six months when I decided to get a pet octopus to see\nfor myself if they were really as smart as people say they are. And after bringing her home to CrunchLabs and putting her into a saltwater optimized and appropriately decorated tank,\nshe made herself right at home. And the first thing that stood out is just\nhow curious they are. For example,\nwhen you put anything into the tank, including your arm, they immediately\nswim towards it and just want to interact. And we'll cover this in a minute. But beyond just being able\nto really securely latch on to things like my hand It’s so strong! Oh my goodness. Her suckers are also gathering information about me,\nlike my smell, taste and color. And so after just a few weeks, given how playful she is, it's hard\nnot to form a quick bond. For example, she loved to go up and wave\nfour tentacles in the jet stream, which I assume is the octopus equivalent of a dog sticking its head out of a car window. She could play catch with us, she had a propensity for selfies\nany time she saw a camera. And whenever we put a toy\nsubmersible in her tank, she would go full 20,000\nleagues under the sea. And as I did more research,\nI learned that for the 100 million octopi every year us humans\nput on a dinner plate or in a pet store, basically, all are born\nand originally raised in the ocean, meaning they aren't bred in captivity, which is when I was hit\nwith the startling realization that essentially made me the bad guy in Finding Nemo. And since no one wants to be the bad guy\nin Finding Nemo, as much as we'd already come to love Sashimi here at CrunchLabs,\nwe did some investigating and found out from the\npet store we got her from the exact spot they pulled her out of the ocean. The only problem\nwith my plan of returning her, was she'd been hand fed\nnow for quite some time. So the idea was that if she could figure out\nand remember how to solve an obstacle course maze then I would be assured\nthat she could figure out and remember her early days\nhunting in the ocean and we could send her back home\nwith confidence. Phase one of the plan\nwas to give her some challenges and then observe her behavior\nto understand what capabilities she actually had. And as it turns out... it's a lot. For starters, their ability to color\nand shapeshift is unmatched in the animal kingdom. For example, can you spot the octopus\nhiding in plain sight right here? The only thing more impressive than that is when you slow it down. Play it in reverse and see just how quickly\nand convincingly these changes occur. And it's not just camouflage\nas a form of protection. They can also mimic the shape of larger,\nmore predatory animals like eels. And as Sashimi shows here,\nand you can see here, they’ve even come up with\nsome pretty creative ways to scoot themselves around. There’s stories from octopus researchers\nwhere they will recognize and shoot water at only one specific person\nany time they walk by the tank. And they'll still recognize that person, even if they switch clothes\nwith other people or other stories where the octopus will repeatedly shoot\nwater jets at the light switch to turn off the lights in the room. It's also not uncommon for them to escape\ntheir tanks at night to better map out the room\nthey're being stored in or to raid the other takes for food only\nto return to their tank in the morning like nothing ever happened. And after a month or two of observation once we had really come to understand each other we had all the data\nwe needed to enter phase two. So after a lot of brainstorming, CAD, 3D printing, and laser cutting. We eventually landed here starting at the conclusion of the \nnine part obstacle course with the Golden Vault. If she can figure out how to unscrew\nthe vault door well then she’s earned the 3 pounds \nof her favorite food: shrimp contained therein and the reason we know it's her favorite\nfood is because over the course of a week, we've prepared an underwater seafood\nbuffet with four different food options. And all four times\nwe repeated the experiment the aroma from the shrimp was consistently\nthe most irresistible. But in order to earn that succulent\nreward, she's got her work cut out for her, starting back at the beginning\nwith challenge number one the over-under. If she finds a way to get under\nthis barrier through these rocks well then she's got to find a way\nto get over this barrier, through these floating balls. And if she manages that,\nthen is through the green circular portal, where she'll find herself face to face\nwith this four panel revolving door. And if she works out\nhow revolving doors work and makes it through the next green portal well then Sashimi will basically be met by a wall and at this point it's game over. Unless she correctly deduces that by pushing this block out she can pass through the corridor and continue her journey upwards\nto the ball drop. And this is where things level up a notch because dexterity becomes much more critical in this case\nshe has to grab this lever and rotate it in this slot,\nwhich will allow it to fall down with the balls trailing behind, clearing\nup the pathway upwards through the tube. But then once she swims up\nthe tube, she'll be trapped because the porthole out is blocked\nby this red gate. that is unless she figures out\nhow to hit the emergency exit button, which will push this\nglass counterweight ball down off the edge, thereby\npulling the gate up and allowing entry into \nperhaps my favorite obstacle, the fish out of water. Because here the only way \nfor Sashimi to continue her progress would be to flex her ability\nto comfortably live on land for up to an hour\nby crawling out of the water up over and back down on the other side, where after passing through the portal she gets a bit of a power up, because on the back side of the\nsnorkeling Phat Gus is a shrimp. Now, this is a bit of a throwback\nto the tourist trap on the squirrel maze, where a strategically placed snack\nled to a timely photo op. But in this case I call it the Medusa because the hope is that as she eats\nthe shrimp with her beak on the underside of where\nher legs all come together it will look like Phat Gus has eight\nbraids of beautiful, flowing hair. And now that she's feeling refreshed, Sashimi can hopefully finish strong\nwith the penultimate challenge, which is sort of a double obstacle because there are six holes in the top ranging from small to really small. And if she takes the easy route\nby squeezing through the least small hole. Well, and she has a lot more maze to deal with as opposed to the smallest hole That puts her right at the finish. Either way, at this point,\nshe's made it here. And if she solves the final puzzle\nby unscrewing the vault door, she's not only earned the \nall-you-can-eat seafood buffet but she’s proven she's quick enough on her tentacles to handle being returned back to her ocean home to the very tide pools\nshe was raised in. So with everything in place, all that was\nleft to do was open this ball valve. And as the smell of fresh shrimp\nmade its way to her tank she made her way down the tube like an eight-legged gladiator\nto her saltwater colosseum. So while we wait for her to\nmake that 40-second trek this is the perfect time to mention that if you want a Christmas\nmorning reaction like this or this, or this, Yes look. Then a CrunchLabs Build Box \nsubscription is the answer. Because with the build box not only do you get a super fun toy that\nyou get to put together every month but you do it alongside me while I teach you all the incredible physics behind\nhow it works. We're right there in the trenches, building, learning, and succeeding together so the principles really sink in. It works. So if you're a kid and you're looking for something\nto put at the top of your Christmas list, or you're just looking to be the household hero\nby giving it to someone else, use the link at the video description\nor head to CrunchLabs.com where were giving away two free boxes\nas a holiday special. Now back to Sashimi. After making it into the main tank then sort of exploring the borders \nof the maze for a bit, she made her way inside fairly quickly,\nbut then sort of just chilled, like she really didn't understand\nwhat she was supposed to do next. But since you can only ignore the ambrosial\nsmell of raw, fresh shrimp for so long she eventually got curious\nand started exploring. And one of the first things we observed\nis that any time she's in a new environment,\nshe kind of maps things out by walking around\ngathering data with her arms as opposed to just swimming around\nfreely through the middle. And soon enough\nshe had things figured out. Now, admittedly, this first challenge\nwas a bit of a softball because having observed\nSashimi in her home tank I knew she was good at digging\nand burrowing herself in the sand, using the water propulsion from her siphon\ntube to clear the rocks away. The floating balls\nwere even less of a challenge for her, and after making it through,\nyou really get a sense of how much she sends out her arms\nas scouts to gather critical information, especially in the wild They can reach their arms around\nand inside crevices, not only to smell not only to smell and taste but, as we'll cover in a minute,\neven see and independently think. So obstacle one was pretty straightforward but figuring out\nhow to operate a revolving door would be a much harder test... Wow. Okay. I see how this is going to be. And this was my first real indicator that\nwe were headed for a real battle of wits. It was a similar feeling to\nwhen the squirrels eventually outsmarted my rope bridge of instability,\nbut just jumping over it altogether. And I really should have seen this coming because as you can see in this video\nof an octopus escaping from a ship, as long as an opening\nis bigger than their beak, which is the only actual hard\npart of their body, then they can eventually squeeze\nthrough it. In fact, if we roll that back. You can see Sashimi’s beak\nor mouth right here. And while this part looks like a big nose,\nthat's actually their main body where all their vital organs reside,\nlike their brain, stomach, gills, kidneys, ink sack, siphon. And there are three hearts. Two other cool facts about octopi is their\nblood is blue because it's copper based, since that's more efficient\nin cold, low oxygen environments. And if they lose an arm,\nthey can regrow it completely and it will look indistinguishable\nfrom the original. Next up was the block push. Once again, she got to this point and was sort of stumped\nwithout an obvious path forward. But this is where their\nnatural curiosity pays off because she's not just feeling surfaces\nwith her arms but also constantly pulling and pushing\nto see what she can interact with. And so sort of by default,\nshe figured out this red part of the wall doesn't push back as hard which cleared the way up to the ball drop. And I knew this one would be tough for her\nbecause, number one there's not enough room for her\nto just squeeze by. And number two, pushing and pulling on\nwalls wasn't going to solve it either. And after struggling in vain\nto find out what she was supposed to do for quite some time, eventually she got\nfrustrated and just stopped and sat there, almost like she was processing\nall the data she just gathered and this was the moment I knew for sure\nI was in over my head because while basically maintaining\neye contact with me as a flex, she reaches up with one arm and then \ntwists the bar, which dislodges the ball allowing her to clear them out \nand move on. And this feels like the perfect moment\nto tell you that my absolute favorite fact about the octopus\nis that they are truly the closest thing we have to intelligent alien life\non this planet. And here's what I mean by that. This is a very simplified version\nof a tree of Life. These kind of diagrams show\nyou how all life is related and what evolved from what. How do we know this? Well, by being true scientific detectives\nand looking for clues. For example, a few hundred years\nago, scientists noticed that us humans have seven vertebrae in our necks,\nbut so did giraffes. But wait a sec. So do whales, mice, elephants, \nlions, horses, and bats. So that's a clue they all share a common ancestor\nand belong to this group called Mammals. And it's not just neck bones Watch what happens if you compare\nthe arm bone configurations of a human to a bat, to a chicken,\nto a turtle, to a dolphin. It's wild what tiny beneficial mutations\nand millions of generations can produce and of course, with genome sequencing\ndeveloping over the last 40 years, it's allowed us to compare\nthe DNA of different species and sort of check our answers in the back of the book. Anyways, using these techniques, if you want to see where our lineage broke off from that of octopi\nin the Tree of Life, you have to go back over half\na billion years ago to a simple flatworm. But if you look closely,\nall of what we think of as the smart animals are over here on this \nside of the tree of Life, including dolphins, dogs, pigs, horses,\nhumans, but even birds, dinosaurs and fish and their intelligence and way of thinking\nare all related to each other. Sort of like those arm bones I showed. But octopi developed their intelligence\ncompletely independently from everything over here,\nlike an alien from another planet. And that's why they're built\njust so differently from us. For example,\nthey have twice as many neurons as a cat. But unlike all the animals over here,\nwhere all the neurons are focused in the brain, in octopi,\nonly one third of their neurons are in the brain\nand the rest are in their arms, which means they not only smell and taste,\nbut they can even think and act independently with their arms. That means that\neven if their arm is cut off, the arm can still camouflage itself\nto the surroundings by sensing light. It would be like closing your eyes, walking into a room, touching a wall\nand having your hand match the color. Having eight independent mini brains,\nalong with a larger central brain is as incomprehensible\nas alien intelligence to us. Now, back at the maze,\nSashimi had made it to the emergency button, putting her at the halfway mark,\nand as usual, she starts by having her arms do all the recon work. And it's almost like once she feels\nthe red door, she figures out my trick and then immediately pushes the button\nto drop the ball and open the gate to move on to my favorite obstacle,\nthe fish out of water. And I was relieved to see\nthat I'd thrown her another curveball because after quite a bit of\nexploratory arm expeditions, she realizes that the only way forward \nis up and out. And so after psyching herself up, she just goes for it, sliding up, over and eventually down. And this demonstrates\nanother octopus superpower because they can survive out of water\nfor up to an hour. And as you can see here Shawday! Theres an octopus eating a crab! It's one of the reasons\nthey're such successful hunters in and around tide pools. And now that we're coming down\nthe final stretch, I figured she deserved\na bit of a snack break with the Medusa. And just like I'd hoped, once\nshe saw the shrimp attached to the back, she starts chomping down with her beak. And since that's right\nat the center of all her legs we get a couple different hair options\nfor Phat Gus starting first with a more free-flowing \nsandy blonde option which eventually morphed\ninto more of a dark-haired up-do. Now, the reason\nshe's able to change her appearance so drastically is because all octopi\nhave four tricks up their sleeve. First,\ntheir skin is covered in tiny little sacs called chromatophores, filled with either black, red or yellow pigment,\nand then they use their muscles to stretch those sacs like a balloon to achieve\nany combination of those three colors. Then they've got a layer below\nthat called Iridophores that bounce back\nspecific wavelengths of light, giving those iridescent blues\nlike peacocks or beetles. Then there's even one more layer\nthat reflects back ambient light called Luciphores. On top of all that, they can also use\na muscular structure called papillae to change the texture of their skin,\ncreating ridges and bumps. And because they could change any of those in\nas little as 200 milliseconds, which is literally less\nthan the blink of an eye, it makes them the true masters of disguise\nin the animal kingdom. Now, she was on to the maze and you can\nsee she opted for the largest hole, which of course means she had the maximum\namount of maze ahead of her. And I love this because it's sort of\nclassic Sashimi at this point, but you can see she's\nwilling to play along for quite a while and make just about every possible\nwrong turn along the way. But then eventually she's over it\nand just cuts right to the end. And while that's technically\nan automatic DQ I took the high road and let it slide. which brought her to the Golden Vault. After a month\nor so of training on all the obstacles, she had finally done it,\nand with the tide on her side, she went straight for the door,\nripped it off the foundation, and then immediately basked in the sweet,\ndelicious taste of a hard earned victory in the largest\nstockpile of shrimp she'd ever seen. And after letting her gorge for a bit, it was time for me\nto uphold my end of the deal and give her the Finding Nemo happy ending\nshe deserved by driving her 8 hours down the coast back to the exact beach\nwhere she was raised. Having figured out and remembered \nthe solutions to all my dumb puzzles I was convinced she could certainly figure out\nand remember what it was like to hunt for her own food\nin the open ocean. And this was a bittersweet moment because there's one octopus fact\nI haven't mentioned, which is their entire lifespan\nis only about one and a half years. And as a final act after laying her eggs,\na female will continually watch over and protect them to the point\nthat she stops eating and dies. Which meant that in the exact same coves\nin tide pools that her mother did for her, soon Sashimi would be extending\nthat ever changing tree of life by one more generation, only, perhaps this time creating a new branch of super-intelligent\npuzzle-solving offspring. With everything you know\nabout Sashimi at this point it should come as no surprise. She also has incredible taste in toys but what should also\nhopefully not surprise you after watching the videos\nI've been making on YouTube for 12 years, is that learning science and engineering\ndoesn't have to be sucky and boring. Which is exactly why\nI started a toy company called CrunchLabs with the expressed goal of helping kids\nthink like an engineer through monthly toys that\nget delivered to your door where you put it together with me. And having already shipped\nmillions of these boxes. The data is in; 87% of kids rate it and 8 out of 10 on a fun scale, out of ten. But here's the dirty secret. More than three out of four parents said their child gained a new passion\naround STEM and engineering from the boxes. Our secret sauce here, just like on\nmy videos, is hiding the vegetables so everyone leaves\nfeeling stoked about the outcome. On top of that, each month\nyour box has a chance to contain the platinum ticket,\nand if you get it well then you're coming out here to CrunchLabs\nto build with me and my team for day. So if you want to embark\non this monthly journey with me and get a Christmas morning\nreaction like this... Yes Oh my God. Just go to CrunchLabs.com or use the link to the video description where we're giving away those two boxes free\nas a holiday special. Thanks for watching.""

"Backyard Squirrel Maze 1.0- Ninja Warrior Course
",0
"'- This is a bird feeder, and everything to my left is my attempt at making it squirrel-proof. If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass\nthrough what is basically an eight-part ""Ninja Warrior""\nobstacle course for squirrels. This course is extremely challenging. It is not for the timid of heart. But out of the gate, I will admit that in hindsight that I completely\nunderestimated my adversary. Now if you\'re wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back eight weeks ago when I found myself stuck\nat home and very bored. So I installed a bird feeder and decided to become a birdwatcher, and it was just so lovely\n(birds chirping) (record scratches)\nuntil they showed up. Now, luckily, my bird feeder\nhad a wire cage around it, big enough for the birds to slip inside but small enough to prevent the squirrels from getting the food, and that worked really\nwell until right here. For me, this was like the\nmoment in ""Jurassic Park"" when they realized the\nVelociraptors can open door handles. And once the door was open, it was clear this wasn\'t\ntheir first rodeo. They basically cleared this\nwhole tube of bird seed by the end of the day. Mind you, this bird feeder was advertised as being squirrel-proof. So I bought another\nsquirrel-proof bird feeder to replace it. It\'s got this outer cage\nsuspended by some springs, and so if a bird comes and lands here, it doesn\'t weigh that much and it has access to the seeds. However, if a squirrel comes,\nthey\'ll grab onto this cage. Its weight will force the springs down, thereby preventing access to the seeds. I have no idea how the squirrels could\npossibly outsmart this, but let\'s see. And this one work exactly as intended. You can see the birds love it, but when the squirrel comes along, the cage shifts down and now all the seed ports are covered up. Every time they tried,\nit was the same results. However, the next morning, this guy manages to unclip the springs that hold the cage up, which means the cage stays\nin the lowered position where it blocks all the seed openings. Problem with that is now\nthey can get to the lid. But this bird feeder\nlid doesn\'t hinge open to give direct access, so he goes with a different tactic, (bird feeder clanking) (birds chirping) where he now has access to\nall the bird seed he wants. And so I decided I would try\none more bird feeder design. Okay. Wow. It almost feels intentional at this point. This one\'s supposed to work well because it\'s got this baffle, which is supposed to keep the squirrels from just coming straight\ndown and getting to the seeds, and more importantly, there\'s no way for them to rip this off. We\'ll see. This one debuted to similar results. As he hangs by a few toes, this is when I really started\nto gain an appreciation for what they were capable of. It definitely seemed like this bird feeder was their favorite. Okay, yeah, they\'re\nflexing on me for sure. And at this point, a plan\nwas forming in my head, but just to be thorough, I moved the post away from the fence. And I can\'t say I was surprised\nwhen they just climbed it, nor was I surprised to\nsee they could shimmy up and down a small metal pole or even a large one for that matter. And whether they could climb\na certain pole material was a moot point anyways because of this! Look at this! These guys are basically freaking\nrodent-sized Simone Biles! And on some level, this is what it felt like\nwhen someone stole a package from my porch that didn\'t belong to them, and I harnessed that indignation, spending a year designing the\nglitter bomb bait package. - Hello. (glitter bomb whirring) - [Mark] Complete with special fragrances. - Aw. - If I could design a\npackage to deter thieves, could I design a bird\nfeeder to deter squirrels? And so after a couple\nweeks of brainstorming, designing, and building\nwith my buddy John, we put it all together in\nthis 20-second build montage. (upbeat music)\n(tools whirring) (aerosol can hissing) (metal clanking) (drill whirring) Here are the basic elements. For starters, here\'s where I\'ve placed\ntheir favorite bird feeder, at the end of the course. And to sweeten the deal, right below that, there\'s a trapdoor. And if they step here, it releases a butt-ton of walnuts and unfurls some celebratory banners. Why walnuts? I\'m glad you asked. I\'m using walnuts because\nover the course of a week, I put out a buffet of seven\ndifferent nuts and seeds. And all four times I\nrepeated the experiment, walnuts were always\nthe one they ate first. What\'s great about placing this here is it levels the playing\nfield as the birds can fly up and get as much food as they\nwant anytime they need it. The squirrels, however,\nwill have to work for it because the only way to\nmake it to this platform is if they work their way through my eight-part ""Ninja\nWarrior"" obstacle course, which all starts right here. This is the only platform on the course that has a pole that isn\'t\ncovered in slippery stuff, which means this is where\nthey have to climb up to enter the course. If they try and get up any other way, they can\'t keep a good grip and they just slide back down. So the first challenge is\nthe Bridge of Instability. Now, this may look easy, but the trick is it attaches\nat a single point on each end. And from a physics standpoint, that makes it no different than trying to crawl across a tightrope. It\'s the same deceptive principle with that one carnival\ngame that\'s so impossible. I broke it down in another\nvideo where I use physics to show which carnival\ngames were basically scams and the science on how to beat them. Next up, the Maze of a Thousand Corridors. This one\'s a bit more cerebral, but if they make it through that, it will bring \'em to\nthe Pitchfork Tumblers, which are inspired by the show ""Wipe Out."" But unlike ""Wipe Out,"" I should point out that all these contraptions\nare squirrel-friendly, and even with a little back force, they will break away and stop spinning. Now, if they can make it past the Pitchfork Tumblers of Treachery, they come to one of my personal favorites, the Homewrecker. (romantic music) I put her in to tempt the\nsquirrel to lose focus on the real prize at\nthe end of the course. Because this pad has a\npressure sensor underneath it and it connects to a microcontroller that has a relay that\nconnects to a solenoid that connects to a pneumatic piston that connects back to this platform with the pressure sensor, and so if they stand here\nfor more than three seconds, they\'ve gotta start the\ncourse all over again. Next up is the Slinky Bridge of Deception. I\'ve suspended a juicy\nwalnut right in the middle, but there\'s no way this bridge\nwill support their weight. So it\'ll be interesting to\nsee how they approach it. The sixth challenge is\ncalled the Tourist Trap. It\'s actually a bit of a\nreward for making it this far. If the squirrel sticks their head through this board my wife painted, it\'s just a photo op\nthey can hang on the wall of their tiny squirrel nest. I\'ll place a walnut here as an incentive for them not to miss\nthis unique opportunity. The penultimate challenge are the Quad Steps of Great Elevation. This is taken straight\nfrom ""Ninja Warrior,"" and this is super tricky because these pads are all totally smooth and placed at a 45-degree incline. And now for the last challenge. At this point, they are a near few feet away\nfrom their ultimate goal. But if they\'re not careful, they\'ll have to deal with\nthe Orbital Assist Platform, aka the Final Countdown, aka ""It\'s not a catapult,\nit\'s a squirrel-pult,"" which means they now have to go back and start all the way\nover from the beginning. Now, if they wanna avoid that fate, they just need to stand on this pad for less than three seconds. But once again, I\'ve\nplaced a diversion here. This one projects an optical illusion of anything you place in\nthe bottom of this dish. It\'s actually super trippy and looks even more\nimpressive in real life because the projected image is 3D. They\'re like nine bucks on Amazon, and I put a link that\nexplains the juicy physics of how they work in the video description. Now with regards to squirrel safety, I know I seem to have this reputation of (fire sizzling) (glass shattering) (people screaming) improvised high-speed projectiles, and so this one might worry a\nfew animal lovers out there, including my wife. We have five pets and one child, and the child was the\nonly one I had a say in. So rest assured, I can adjust\nthe pressure on the piston, and we\'ll be staying way\nbelow any launch force that could hurt any of our\nadorable backyard contestants. And so, finally, after\nmaking it through all that, we\'re back here at the world\'s\nmost satisfying bird feeder. And as far as I\'m concerned,\nif they make it here, they\'ve earned the right\nto gorge next to the birds for as long as they want. And so after nearly a month of prep work, the course was officially\nopen for business. (lighthearted music) They could smell the walnuts\nat the final station, and you could see the gears turning because right above that was\ntheir favorite bird feeder. And so before long, we\nhad our first contender. (bright electronic music) That didn\'t exactly go as planned, so Rick decides to regroup. Speaking of which, that\'s Rick. There are a total of four competitors that will be attempting the course. First up is Rick, and he weighs 500 grams. I know this \'cause he\'s actually standing on a custom-made scale. Rick is very clever as\nyou\'ll see here in a minute, but he also gets spooked easily. Next up is Marty. He\'s basically\nindistinguishable from Rick. Rick and Marty are inseparable and pretty much spend all\ntheir time together as a pair. Our third contender is Frank, also coming in around 500 grams. He\'s very gutsy. He\'s also kinda dumb. Finally, we\'ve got my\npersonal favorite, Phat Gus. He\'s just really charming and will strike a pose\nif he sees a camera. He also really likes to eat, and he tips the scales at\nan impressive 800 grams. While most of the squirrels\nare kind of particular before making a selection and then gracefully leaping away, Phat Gus just goes for it, hands-free, just makes himself real comfortable. Here he is laying out with a light snack from the bird feeder. I mean, you can\'t fault the guy for just clearly appreciating a good meal. So now that you know our four contenders, let\'s get back to Rick. So he hops back on, and he\'s actually doing\nbetter than his first attempt. Mm, just barely. This is the best because he\'s like, ""Okay, I got this. Nevermind. Well, maybe I, no, I definitely don\'t."" And this was the exact moment I realized I just might be outmatched here. (playful music) Marty was watching Rick and, after a quick dip\nof his toes in the water, adopts his strategy right out of the gate. Ooh, so close, but an excellent recovery. And Phat Gus, perhaps predictably,\ncomes up a little short, which brings us to the Maze\nof a Thousand Corridors, which, to be honest, they\nmastered this one pretty quickly. Here\'s a solid run from Phat Gus. And now for the Pitchfork\nTumblers of Treachery. Marty was like, ""Yeah,\nthat\'s a hard pass."" Phat Gus is just like, ""Abort!"" Frank is just like, ""Nope."" Then he\'s like, ""Wait a second. Mm, still nope."" Then Marty flies in real hot over the top. He didn\'t make it through, but that\'s partial credit\nas far as I\'m concerned. And then here\'s Phat Gus with\nmy favorite attempt by far. (bright music) And then Frank shows no fear, which helps him pull up\nthis near-flawless run. And finally, Smart Rick\nsurgically weaves his way through essentially untouched. And I should mention, the squirrels were most\nactive from 6:00 to 10:00 AM, so every morning I\'ve been\ngetting up before the sunrise to start filming from in my house, like one of those camouflage\nnature photographers, only like a suburbanized version. I\'ve also had a handful of\nstreaming cameras rolling 24/7, which has allowed me to\nmake such discoveries as we have the world\'s worst guard dog. Thanks for the help, pal. Now back to the Homewrecker. You could see Rick is\ninstinctively suspicious of this gold digger and only for a brief\nmoment puts his full weight on the platform. I told you he was smart. His buddy Marty, on the other hand... She is a cruel mistress. And because I know my\nwife is going to ask me, no, this will not hurt the\nsquirrel for two reasons. Number one, they are amazing like cats and always land on their feet. And two, they themselves were jumping from this height all the time, and in some cases, much higher. In fact, squirrels are\none of the few mammals that can survive a fall from any height because they make their\nterminal velocity so low. You can see it right here. They make their body as flat as possible, then put their tail back to increase drag. They basically become their own parachute. And then right before they land, they pull in and fully\nextend their arms and legs to act as shock absorbing landing gear. This is so cool. Now back to the course where even Smart Rick\neventually lets his guard down, which is exactly when she strikes. But just like all the\nother obstacles so far, after a day or two, they\'d mastered it. In this case, even disregarding her\noffering of a fresh walnut. Now onto the Slinky Bridge of Deception, and this was the sleeper\nobstacle in my book. That is not a large gap,\nwhich they can easily jump, but having the slinky there\njust threw them off somehow. You can see how much\nFrank is struggling here, and he\'s the brave one. And Rick only jumps when Marty shows up for emotional support. But like all the obstacles so far, after a day or two, they\'d mastered it. Now onto our third to last\nobstacle, the Tourist Trap, and this one was just a freaking delight. A little peanut butter\nreally did the trick here. (camera shutter clicks) (playful music) Now here comes Phat Gus. And I mean, how Phat Gus is this? He sees the camera and he\'s like, ""Paint me like one of\nyour French squirrels. Yeah? No? No takers? All right."" Here\'s another classic Gus where he looks at the\ncamera, wait a second. Play that back,\n(electronic whirring) and freeze. Zoom, enhance.\n(electronic beeping) (record scratches)\n(eerie music) (air whooshes)\n(keyboard clacking) (lighthearted music) Well, turns out Phat Gus is\nnot a dude and he\'s pregnant, which meant I was suddenly\nfeeling real uncomfortable about all those weight comments. So after a bit of a pivot\nto smooth things over, we soldiered on to the Quad\nSteps of Great Elevation. Frank comes in rather\nconfident, almost to his demise, but he pulls off the smooth recovery. So after not much time at all, they were looking pretty good here. In fact, one morning, I noticed Marty totally skipped\nthe last step altogether, which I took as a challenge, and so I removed the middle\nstep to see what they would do. And who else but Phantastic Gus? Let\'s slow that down a bit. They\'re such amazing jumpers, so I suppose the quick mastery\nhere wasn\'t a surprise. I mean, this right here is\nprobably a 10-foot jump. And here\'s some classic\nbrave but dumb Frank. He\'d already entered the course normally and made it to the Homewrecker\nat least a dozen times by this point, and yet for some reason, he decides this 12-foot jump\nis his best course of action. And Smart Rick was the first\none to enter the course. So in the end, after\nabout a week of effort, it was fitting he was the one to make it to the jackpot first. And he\'s so stoked he apparently wants to run\nthe whole course in reverse. In hindsight, we probably should have made\nthe jackpot a little quieter. Here\'s Marty, as always, not far behind. (light music) He\'s also a bit flighty as you know, which worked against him here, because down below, Phantastic Gus, ever the opportunist, comes through with the\nreal stroke of brilliance. But pretty soon, Marty comes back like, ""Um, I\'m the one who kinda earned that."" And then Phantastic Gus is like, ""You snooze, you lose, sucker!"" And might I just say, Phantastic Gus, when you sit like that, you don\'t look an ounce over 700 grams. Eventually, they learned\nthat sound was a good thing and they\'d quickly return for their reward before Phantastic Gus got any ideas. So here\'s a single camera\nshot of a full run. And by the end, all of them\ncould do the full course in less than 40 seconds. And while we\'re watching, you might be wondering what\nhappened to the squirrel-pult. Unfortunately, they didn\'t\nreally fall for my illusion much, but I\'m about to show you\nthe two times they did. And as a promise to my wife, I turned the pressure\nto only 40% full power, so the acceleration\nthe squirrel would feel is about half a g, which is 10 times less than\na typical rollercoaster. Additionally, I never turned on either the Homewrecker\ntrapdoor or the launch platform when I wasn\'t actively\nwatching from inside my house where I had a manual override button, because as safe as it was, something about launching Phantastic Gus just didn\'t feel right. Now what you\'re about to see\nis gonna look pretty chaotic. But when we check the slow-mo, amazingly, I\'ll show you how the squirrel is totally in control pretty much the whole time. All right, now here\'s a second angle. Also, even if you don\'t\ntrust my calculations, I can assure you that the\nsquirrels did not care. In both launch cases, they were back up on the\ncourse in like five minutes. Here\'s the slow-mo, and see if you could spot the\ntwo critical things he does to make sure he lands feet down. Did you catch it? The first critical moment is right here. He\'s already done the predictive math, and he\'s locked his head on the\nspot where he plans to land. And now his head will not lose\nthat lock the whole way down. What\'s crazy is the time it takes him to do all the predictive math to know exactly where he will land and to lock his head is 300 milliseconds. That\'s exactly this long. Literally less than the blink of an eye. That blows my mind. But if you think about it, it makes sense these\nreactions would\'ve evolved to be razor-sharp if you live your life in the trees constantly making split-second decisions. Now, besides picking the\nlanding spot with his head, the second trick is with his arms. When he wants to keep his\nupper body from rotating, he has his arms out. But the moment he wants to\nrotate his upper body quickly, he tucks them in. And then when he wants to stop rotating, he extends them out again. This is straight up conservation\nof angular momentum. It\'s the same trick ice skaters use. Basically, bring your limbs\nin if you want to rotate fast, extend them out if you\nwanna slow the rotation. My buddy Destin from Smarter Every Day also made a video analyzing\nhow cats always land on their feet, and they do the exact same two tricks. The head target lock and bringing limbs in to rotate and out to stop rotation. (air whooshes)\nHere\'s the second launch. So this may look like\npure luck in real time, but the slow-mo tells a different story. In that amount of time, he\'s already made a slight\nlateral push in that direction and locked his landing\ntarget with his head. We know from the previous\nclip he can rotate his body to any orientation, but he doesn\'t in this case because he sees his small\npush has already aligned him for the perfect landing. That\'s just so cool. And so after those two\nphysics demonstrations, I disabled both the Launcher\nand the Homewrecker trapdoor and just let them enjoy\nthe course in peace. As far as I was concerned,\nthey had earned it. Plus, after spending a month together, we were sort of bros by this point. If they saw me coming out to work, they would certainly jump away, but then they\'d just\nquickly be right back. And sadly, all good things\nmust come to an end. And because I didn\'t want them to develop an unhealthy\ndependence on my handouts, after about a week of free\nreign, I took down the course. But in its place, I put up a specialized\nsquirrel-sized picnic table. Every morning, this door opens to\nrelease just a few walnuts as a little treat to remind\nthem of our good times together. Although I had to laugh\nthat after all this, somehow I didn\'t anticipate on day one Frank would immediately try and figure out and partially succeed in finding\na way to beat the system. Like everything else though,\nthey quickly caught on, and now on some mornings, I\'ll catch them just waiting\nfor the daily ration, chilling patiently on the bench seat, that is, everyone but Phantastic Gus. Don\'t ever change, buddy. When I started this\ntwo-month-long adventure trying to bird-watch, I had no idea I would enjoy\nsquirrel-watching so much more. It\'s also made me realize that\neven amongst the structures and pavement and power lines, how interesting nature can be\nin a single suburban backyard if you just really stop to look. Even the plants are amazing! I had no idea that as vines grow, they spin around looking\nfor something to grab onto. I didn\'t anticipate the\nwide variety of animals that use fences as inner yard highways to get around as a substitute\nfor all the trees that existed before we got here. Even little interactions like\nthis spider extending his life with this very timely leap into the unknown were\njust so delightful to see. But of all the animals, I can definitively say now that squirrels are my absolute favorite, and they\'re certainly a\nmore formidable adversary than porch pirates. They\'re kind of adorable, incredibly crafty, curious by nature, athletic, and persistent. Turns out, squirrels can\nlive to be 20 years old, and so I like to think that someday, Phantastic Gus will bring his\ngrand-squirrels to the fence and regale them with tales\nof cowboys and courage and legendary walnut piles.

"How to spot a fad diet - Mia Nacamulli
",0
"Conventional wisdom about diets, including government \nhealth recommendations, seems to change all the time. And yet, ads routinely come about claiming to have the answer \nabout what we should eat. So how do we distinguish \nwhat's actually healthy from what advertisers just want us\nto believe is good for us? Marketing takes advantage of\nthe desire to drop weight fast, and be stronger, slimmer, and brighter. And in the big picture, diet plans\npromising dramatic results, known as fad diets, are just what they seem:\ntoo good to be true. So where do diet fads even come from? While the Ancient Greeks and Romans rallied behind large-scale \nhealth regimens centuries earlier, this phenomenon began in earnest\nin the Victorian Era with crazes like the vinegar diet and the Banting Diet. Since then, diets have advised us \nall sorts of things: to excessively chew, to not chew at all, to swallow a grapefruit per meal, non-stop cabbage soup, even consumption of arsenic, or tapeworms. If the idea of diet crazes \nhas withstood history, could this mean that they work? In the short term, \nthe answer is often yes. Low-carbohydrate plans, like the popular Atkins \nor South Beach Diets, have an initial diuretic effect. Sodium is lost until the body\ncan balance itself out, and temporary fluid weight loss may occur. With other high-protein diets,\nyou might lose weight at first since by restricting your food choices, you are dropping \nyour overall calorie intake. But your body then lowers \nits metabolic rate to adjust to the shift, lessening the diet's effect over time and resulting in a quick reversal\nif the diet is abandoned. So while these diets \nmay be alluring early on, they don't guarantee long-term benefits\nfor your health and weight. A few simple guidelines, though,\ncan help differentiate between a diet that is beneficial \nin maintaining long-term health, and one that only offers temporary\nweight changes. Here's the first tipoff: If a diet focuses on intensely cutting\nback calories or on cutting out entire food groups, like fat, sugar, or carbohydrates, chances are it's a fad diet. And another red flag is ritual, when the diet in question instructs you\nto only eat specific foods, prescribed combinations, or to opt for particular food substitutes, like drinks, bars, or powders. The truth is shedding pounds\nin the long run simply doesn't have a quick-fix solution. Not all diet crazes tout weight loss. What about claims of superfoods, cleanses,\nand other body-boosting solutions? Marketing emphasizes the allure of products associated with ancient \nand remote cultures to create a sense of mysticism\nfor consumers. While so-called superfoods,\nlike blueberries or açaí, do add a powerful punch of nutrients, their super transformative qualities\nare largely exaggeration. They are healthy additions \nto a balanced diet, yet often, they're marketed\nas part of sugary drinks or cereals, in which case the negative properties\noutweight the benefits. Cleanses, too, may be great in moderation since they can assist \nwith jumpstarting weight loss and can increase the number of fresh\nfruits and vegetables consumed daily. Scientifically speaking, though, they've not yet been shown to have\neither a long-term benefit or to detox the body any better than\nthe natural mechanisms already in place. Everywhere we look, we're offered solutions \nto how we can look better, feel fitter, and generally get ahead. Food is no exception, but advice on what we should eat is best\nleft to the doctors and nutritionists who are aware of our \nindividual circumstances. Diets and food fads \naren't inherently wrong. Circumstantially, \nthey might even be right, just not for everyone all of the time.""

"'Translator: Maurício Kakuei Tanaka\nReviewer: Adam Fitzgerald My little brother was very good at a few things\nfrom a very young age. The first thing he was really good at\nwas making everybody laugh without trying. Like the one time I told him he should have a little bit\nof protein after a workout. He got all excited\nbecause he thought I said ""poutine."" (Laughter) The second thing he was good at\nwas eating large quantities of food. Come dinner time, it wasn\'t uncommon for him to outeat\nmost of the adults at the table. Now, as you may have guessed, \nas a five-foot-nothing little boy, there is, in fact, a downside \nto regularly outeating full-grown men. At just 11 years old, I could already see\nthat, if nothing else changed, my little brother was headed\nfor an adolescent life littered with teasing\nand unhealthy eating. As his older brother,\nI wanted to do something about it. As a nutrition, or kinesiology student,\nwith an intense interest in nutrition, I knew that I had to do\nsomething about it. Initially, I wasn\'t sure how,\nbut I was determined to find a way. Now, in March of 2013, I broke my leg while I was\nwalking to class, and I slipped on some ice. Yes, that is the whole story. I was walking, there was some ice. Poof, broken leg. No lives saved. No purses returned. No cool story to tell. Little did I know as I lay there\nin that quickly melting puddle of ice, waiting for the ambulance to arrive, that this moment would forever \nchange the life of my little brother. After I had a surgery to attach a small titanium plate\nand a few screws onto my fibula, I was given two crutches, and told not to put any weight\non my leg for two months. This posed a unique problem, as there was still plenty\nof snow and ice on the ground. And I still had two months left of class, spread out over one of the largest\ncampuses in the country. So, with that in mind, \nI made a decision that any hard-working student \nin my position would do. And I obviously decided\nto stop going to classes. (Laughter) Now, with all this free time\nfrom studying at home, I had finally figured out\nhow I was going to help my little brother. I knew that what he needed to do\nwas very simple in theory, but very difficult in practice. What he needed to do\nwas change his eating habits. From experience I knew the things that he needed\nto change, and the things that he didn\'t. The problem was that communicating\nthis through somebody else would most likely just end up\nlike the childhood game of telephone. The message gets passed along, but with little misunderstandings\nand misinterpretations along the way. There\'s not much left\nof the original message, and everybody\'s just left confused. And my little brother\'s eating habits\nare left unchanged. So, keeping that in mind, I made\none of the best decisions of my life, and I decided to move back home\nfor the next two weeks, and make every single meal\nthat my little brother would eat, educating him about proper\nnutrition along the way. While I was at home, in the kitchen, I often found myself\nawkwardly trying to maneuver holding on to two crutches,\nhot pans, and sharp knives. It wasn\'t very easy. I also had to make sure to take\nlittle breaks every few minutes to make sure that the swelling in my ankle\nwouldn\'t become unbearable. Now, after just two weeks, not only were the results phenomenal, but they were as a result of a strategy\nthat anybody can use. The reason we were able to see\nsuch dramatic and positive results, which I\'m very excited\nto share with you later, is that we changed his environment\nto match his goal. We made his environment work for him,\ninstead of against him. This simply meant replacing\nall of the bad options with healthy ones. Making this uncomplicated adjustment enabled us to easily\ntransform his nutrition, from the standard American diet, ironically referred to\nfrom its acronym SAD, to wholesome and nutritious\nwithout a hitch. Because of the planning this\nwasn\'t the least bit difficult to do. When you remove the unhealthy options, wholesome and nutritious food\nbecomes both plan A, and plan B. The beauty of this solution is that it takes willpower\nalmost completely out of the equation. Quite simply, if it\'s not there,\nyou can\'t eat it. An added bonus to this strategy is if there\'s no chips\non the counter calling your name, it\'s likely that you\'ll just\nforget about them, and completely avoid the feeling\nof deprivation all at once. Little bit of a brain block. This may sound a little bit\ntoo simple to be true, but I assure you it\'s not. When you remove the barriers\nto your success -- in my little brother\'s case,\nunhealthy food -- and you replace, or you pave\nthe way, barrier-free, the road to success\nbecomes a much smoother ride. So set up your environment so that it works for you,\ninstead of against you. This works well for any goal. For my little brother,\nI was the environment. I made all of his food,\ngave him the right snacks, and answered all of his questions. But what would that have\nlooked like if I wasn\'t there, and how can you make this work for you? Well, to be successful, you have to minimize\nthe difficult decisions being made. Say, for example, you walk into the lobby, and, on the left of those tables,\nis delicious chocolate chip cookies, squares, and everything you like. On the right side,\nis fresh fruit and vegetables, vibrant colors, chopped up nicely,\nthey\'re crunchy and juicy. You\'ve been sitting in here\nfor two hours, so you\'re starving, you have a choice to make. Should you choose option A on the left, or should you choose the wholesome\nnutritious broccoli on the right? Given this scenario, I think it would be very hard\nfor most of us to resist the temptation of option A. This is a real-life situation, and it\'s one that happens all the time. It\'s very important,\nbecause of that reason. So when you remove\nthe barriers to your success, it will just become a little bit easier for you to not have to make\nthat hard decision in the first place. Here\'s how you can make\nthis strategy work for yourself. Start off by finding out\nwhat your personal trigger foods are, and make a promise to not keep them\nin your house anymore. So that when the time comes, the decision has already\nbeen made for you. Now, that\'s not to say you can never\nhave these foods again. If you really want one, you can always\njust go to the store, and buy one, or you can keep it so that you\'re only having them\nat special events, such as this. Just don\'t keep a stash\nunderneath the cupboard if you know that they\'re going\nto be an issue for you. That\'s how you make your environment\nwork for you, instead of against you. That\'s how you make healthy eating the default, and not the exception. So if you have a personal goal\nof eating better, go home, find all of your junk food, and a neighbor that you\'re\nnot particularly fond of, and give it all to them. The basis of this strategy worked\nfor my little 11-year-old brother, and it can certainly work for you too. Let me just finish off by sharing the final results\nof my little brother\'s lifestyle change. Let me also just point out, that I had one main rule\nthat I wanted to follow with the change. At no point, did I want my 11-year-old brother\nto feel hungry, or deprived. Here\'s how that worked out. After the first seven days,\nhe had lost five pounds. After the second week,\nit was eight pounds. But it didn\'t just stop there. I went back to write exams,\nand he kept going. After 20 days, it was ten pounds, and, by 36 days, he had averaged half a pound a day to top it off at 18 pounds lost. (Applause) [Make your environment work FOR YOU] If everybody had their environment\nworking for them, instead of against them, my little brother\'s level of success\nwould be the norm. My hope is that one day it will be. Thank you. (Applause)'
